A light-hearted app I wrote, modeled after a statement I memorized when I was 16 because it seemed so obscure yet could apply to virtually anything: 
<blockquote>
"In it, an almost preternatural insight into the significance of intelligible form is fused with a lyrical sensuality that prevents stylization from becoming academic and lifeless, the mere repetition of formula." 
</blockquote>
That's from Philip Sherrard in an essay on Byzantine art (but I haven't been able to track down the *exact* source; if you find it let me know). All the phrases in the app come from my own imagination. Enjoy ;-)
