### My graduate school mentor

<img src="StevePalmer.jpg" alt="photo of person" style="width:150px !important;">

My (Kruschke's) graduate mentor was <em><b>Prof. Stephen Palmer</b></em>, University of California at Berkeley, during the years 1983-1989.  Steve was tremendously supportive and encouraging of my intellectual pursuits. He showed me repeatedly --by example and by direct instruction-- what it meant to think rigorously and incisively, and what it meant to write and present clearly. (BTW, his textbook, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/vision-science" target="_blank">Vision Science</a>, is nothing less than monumental and shows the clarity and scope of his teaching.) He was perspicacious enough to teach a seminar regarding the just-published PDP (parallel distributed processing, a.k.a. connectionism) books, which became a launching pad for my subsequent ideas. I worked hard on a number of projects with Steve (regarding reference frames in shape perception), and with Danny Kahneman and Anne Triesman and John S. Watson (regarding perception of causality). Unfortunately, none of the projects produced data that were publishable! The lack of publications meant that Steve's support was all the more crucial. Danny Kahneman told me, as I was fearfully sending out job applications, "At this point Steve can do more for you than you can do for you." Thanks Steve!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous paragraph has been posted for decades. Tragically, Steve Palmer died in 2023 (age 75). He is remembered and he is missed.
