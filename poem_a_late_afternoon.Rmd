## A Late Afternoon Lying on My Back

[Withheld until publication.]

<!-- I want to believe\ -->
<!-- the curtain blocking out the day\ -->
<!-- is like a palm tree casting diamond shade.\ -->

<!-- The weight of blanket on my upturned toes\ -->
<!-- is like some beach sand warm beneath my feet.\ -->

<!-- But if I am honest,\ -->
<!-- the curtain blocking out the day\ -->
<!-- is not a palm tree casting diamond shade.\ -->

<!-- The weight of blanket on my upturned toes\ -->
<!-- is not the beach sand warm beneath my feet.\ -->

<!-- The heartbeat pulsing flushes in my ears\ -->
<!-- is not the rhythmic surf upon the shore.\ -->

<!-- The forced air hissing through the vent\ -->
<!-- is not the sea breeze kiss caressing skin.\ -->

<!-- The floaters in my vitreous eyes\ -->
<!-- are not the sea birds hovering in time.\ -->

<!-- The vacant half of mattress at my side\ -->
<!-- is not your towel waiting while you swim.\ -->
