<center><h2>A Model of Information Integration
</h2></center>

<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Suppose you are deciding to what
extent a new acquaintance is worth building a friendship with.  Either
consciously or unconsciously, you evaluate the acquaintance and decide
what to do. Your evaluation might combine many different attributes of
the person: Is the person good-natured? bold? humorless? level-headed?
unsophisticated? ungrateful? and so forth.  How do you combine the
various attributes into a single decision about building a
friendship?

<p>In general, how do people integrate information when making
decisions?  This is the question addressed in the present homework.
At the end of the homework, in the <strong>So what?</strong> section,
you can read a little more about the ramifications.

<p><strong>Try it yourself.</strong> You'll see a series of personal
characteristics for a hypothetical person, and you give a rating of
how likable such a person would be.  After making 36 ratings, you'll
take a look at your data and decide whether an "additive integration
model" fits your data.

<p>Do not print this page or the rating cases. After the
ratings, a message will tell you what to print.
