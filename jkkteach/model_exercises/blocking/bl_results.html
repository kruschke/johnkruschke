<h3>Memory for Training Cases:</h3>

<p>For both diseases, accuracy during the test phase was extremely good.

<p>
<h3>Blocking Test Cases:</h3>

<p>There was a blocking effect, on average, with people tending to
prefer disease B for the blocking cases.  That is, the mean of -0.31
is significantly less than zero, <em>t</em>(70)=3.95, <em>p</em>&lt;.01.

<p>There were notable individual differences, however.  Below is a
frequency distribution of individual means for the blocking cases.  It
can be seen that many people showed no blocking effect, and a few even
the opposite of a blocking effect.  But a significant number of people
did exhibit blocking.

<p><h3>Overshadowing Test Cases:</h3>


<p>There was an overshadowing effect, on average, with people tending
to prefer disease A for the overshadowing cases.  That is, the mean of
0.51 is significantly greater than zero, <em>t</em>(70)=6.04,
<em>p</em>&lt;.01.

<p>There were notable individual differences, however.  Below is a
frequency distribution of individual means for the overshadowing
cases.  It can be seen that many people showed no overshadowing
effect, and a few even the opposite of an overshadowing effect.  But a
significant number of people did exhibit overshadowing.

<p><h3>Correlation of Blocking with Overshadowing</h3>

<p>It turns out that there was a significant correlation of blocking
with overshadowing.  That is, if a person showed overshadowing, then
he or she tended also to show blocking.  The correlation was highly
significant, with r = -.612.  A scatterplot of 71 individuals is shown
below.  Notice that many people (21) showed zero blocking and zero
overshadowing, but many other people showed both, with covarying
magnitude.
