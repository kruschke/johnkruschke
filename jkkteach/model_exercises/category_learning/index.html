<center><h2>Models of Categorization</h2></center>

<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Suppose you encounter an individual
animal you've never seen before.  Usually it is not too difficult to
categorize the animal as a dog or cat or whatever.  How is it that we
can categorize never-before-seen stimuli?  How do we mentally
represent the categories we know, so that we can generalize this
knowledge to novel stimuli?

<p>In this assignment you will explore several models of how people
mentally represent categories that they have learned, and how 
people use these representations to categorize new instances.


<p><strong>Try it yourself.</strong> You'll see a series of 16 simple
geometric forms that you should learn to classify as belonging to
category X or category O.  Each case consists of a rectangle that
varies in its height from instance to instance, with an small interior
segment that varies in its lateral position.  For each case you see,
try to memorize it before going on to the next case.  At the end of
the series, you'll see four novel stimuli that you should categorize as
best you can, based on what you learned up to that time.

<p>Do not print this page or the category-learning cases.  After the
learning sequence, a message will tell you what to print.
