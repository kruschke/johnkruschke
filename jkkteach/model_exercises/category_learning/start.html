<p><strong>Do not proceed unless you will have ten minutes of
uninterrupted and undistracted use of the computer.</strong> At the
end of learning, you will also need a working printer, so be sure the
printer is operational.

<p>You will see a series of rectangles with a small interior vertical
line.  From trial to trial, the rectangle will have different heights
and the interior line will be in different positions.  Your job is to
learn which combinations of rectangles and lines belong to
<em>Category X</em> and which belong to <em>Category O</em>.

<p>As each rectangle with line is shown, you will be asked to
categorize it as an X or an O, and after submitting your answer, you
will be shown the correct categorization.  At first you will just be
guessing, but after a few trials you will learn which is which.

<p><font size=+2><strong><em>Please study the items carefully, because you
will have only 16 trials in which to learn the
categorization.</em></strong></font>

<p>After learning for 16 trials, you will be shown some novel
rectangles with lines, and asked to give your rating of whether they
probably belong to category X or category O.
