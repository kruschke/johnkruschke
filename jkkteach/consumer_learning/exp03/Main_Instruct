Rafting!</font> In this experiment you browse a catalog of whitewater
rafts.  Each page describes a raft, and includes the features
emphasized by the <em>Society of Whitewater Rafters</em> and their
quality rating for the raft. After you paddle through all the rafts in
this catalog, you'll be given a consumer survey, in which you predict
the quality of some new rafts that are still in the design stages. The
manufacturer wants to know what you think the quality will
be. <strong>So, when browsing the catalog, try to learn what matters
for the quality of the rafts.</strong> You can browse the rafts as
much as you like, but <em>you must view every raft at least once</em>
before the computer will flow to the survey phase. Always use the
selection table below to move from one raft to another. Again, <em>you
must view every raft at least once.</em>
