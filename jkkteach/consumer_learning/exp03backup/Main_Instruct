Rafting!</font> In this experiment you browse a catalog of whitewater
rafts.  Each raft has a description, along with the
features emphasized by the <em>Society of Whitewater Rafters</em> and
that organization's quality rating for the raft.  After you study all
the rafts in this catalog, you'll be given a consumer survey, in which
you predict the quality of some new rafts that are still in the design
stages. The manufacturer wants to know what you think the quality will
be. <strong>So, when browsing the catalog, try to learn what matters
for the quality of the rafts.</strong> You can browse the rafts as
much as you like, but <em>you must view every raft at least once</em>
before the computer will move on to the survey phase. Always use the
selection table below to move from one raft to another; never use the
"back" button unless explicitly told to do so.
