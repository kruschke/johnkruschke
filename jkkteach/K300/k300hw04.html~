Homework 4, Due at the beginning of class, Tuesday Feb. 15, 2005.
<br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION. DO NOT YET DO THIS.

</h3>

Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work -- an
unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations that mysteriously ends
up with the correct numerical answer will <em>not</em> be given full
credit <li>answer every part of every question (unless instructed
otherwise).

<em>Rosenberg Excel worksheet 4-2.</em> Work through to the sheet
labeled "your data (n=9)". 
<ul>
<li>Before following the instructions on that sheet, make the
following correction: Notice in cell B18 the formula is
=AVERAGE(B9:B17). That is correct; the numbers in row 18 should be the
means of the 9 numbers above them. But in all the subsequent columns,
the formula is entered incorrectly. For example, in column C the
formula in cell C18 is =AVERAGE(C10:C17) but it should be
=AVERAGE(C9:C17). To fix this error, select cell B18, then drag the
lower right corner of the selection box over all the highlighted cells
to its right in row 18.

<li>Now follow the instructions on the worksheet, but for the random
number seed, use the last four digits of your student ID number.

<li>Print just the first page of that sheet (not all 50 columns), so we
can see the mean of the sample means and the SD of the sample means.
</ul>

<li> ** pts.

<em>Excel project: Sampling distribution of the mean.</em> This is
much like the Rosenberg spreadsheet in the previous exercise, but laid
out differently. Variations of this spreadsheet will be used in future
homework assignments, which is why I'm having you get familiar with
the layout now.

<ul>
<li>Get the spreadsheet from the Oncourse Group Space, "Excel
Spreadsheets". The name of the file is K300HW4_SampDistMean.xls.
<li><em>Carefully</em> follow the directions displayed in green in the
spreadsheets. Notice that there are three sheets in the workbook. Do
all three.  <li>Print out one page for each of the three worksheets,
i.e., three pages total, such that each page shows the Mean of the
Sample Means, etc., in column J. You might have to use landscape
orientation when you print. <li>On each page of the print out, circle
the Z-score of the 95th %ile and write next to it what it should be,
in theory, if we had an infinite number of samples instead of just
500.
