K300 Statistics, Prof. Kruschke
<h3>
Homework 10, Due at the beginning of class, Tuesday April 26, 2005.
<!-- <br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- DO NOT YET DO -->

</h3>

<p>Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work as
appropriate -- an unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations that
mysteriously ends up with the correct numerical answer will
<em>not</em> be given full credit <li>answer every part of every
question (unless instructed otherwise).

<p><b>Reminder of how to do two-factor ANOVA in Excel:</b> On the
Schedule tab of Oncourse, find the Excel spreadsheet named
TwoFactorANOVA.xls. On its second worksheet you'll find info about how
to do two-factor ANOVA in Excel.

<p><li>10 pts.  Page 331, #23.  There are two significant results for
which to describe the meaning. Also answer this: Where exactly do the
values M=9.08 and M=7.46 come from, in terms of the four values in the
bar graph?

An experimenter is interested in whether marking words with a color
highlighter improves memory for those words. She is also interested in
whether words are better remembered when they are accompanied by a
picture. So she gives people a list of 24 words (which they studied
for 50 seconds), and then has them recall (by writing) as many words
as they can. Some people see the words in just black and white text,
some in color highlighted text (with different words in different
colors), some with black and white pictures next to the words, and
some with color highlighted pictures and words. Here are the number of
words correctly recalled for each group:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no picture, no color: 22, 12, 20, 14, 14, 12

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no picture, with color: 14, 10, 19, 10, 15, 14

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with picture, no color: 11, 7, 11, 15, 16, 12

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with picture, with color: 9, 9, 16, 9, 9, 9

<br>Do an ANOVA in Excel. You'll need to enter the data in an array,
and appropriately label the rows and columns.  Print out the data
table and results of the ANOVA. Next to the output table, clearly
write answers to these questions:

<p>A. Is there a significant interaction between picture inclusion
and coloring? Indicate exactly where in the output you find the answer
to this question.

<p>B. What is the mean number of words recalled when there is no
picture? What is the mean number of words recalled when there is a
picture? Is there a significant main effect of picture inclusion?
Indicate exactly where in the output you find the answers to these
questions.

<p>C. What is the mean number of words recalled when there is no
color? What is the mean number of words recalled when there is color?
Is there a significant main effect of color?  Indicate exactly where
in the output you find the answers to these questions.

<p>(By the way, these data are real. My daughter wondered about this
and so designed the experiment, with relatively little input from me,
although she didn't do the ANOVA.  The data are from her classmates at
the time. They were in 5th grade.)

<p><li>10 pts.  

We want to know if the lengths of baby names have been changing over
the years.  Visit
<a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames">
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames</a> and scroll to the
section called <i>Popular Names by Birth Year</i>.  Select "2003" for
year of birth and "Top 50" for Popularity. When the table of results
appears, select all 50 rows of the info (drag your cursor over it) and
copy and paste it into an Excel spreadsheet, starting in cell B2. Your
Excel spreadsheet should now have 50 rows and 5 columns, just like the
website table. Go back to the website, and select "1990" for the year
of birth (and still "top 50"). Get the data and put it into Excel
below the previous data. In your Excel spreadsheet, delete the values
from the columns containing the number of babies with those
names. Then, have Excel compute the number of letters in each name by
using the "len()" function (as we did in Homework 7). Finally, add
appropriate row and column labels.

<p>Print out the results of the ANOVA (but don't print out the data
table; that would kill too many trees). Next to the output table,
clearly write answers to these questions:

<p>A. Is there a significant interaction between year and gender?
Indicate exactly where in the output you find the answer to this
question.

<p>B. What is the mean name length for boys? For girls?  Is there a
significant main effect of gender?  Indicate exactly where
in the output you find the answers to these questions.

<p>C. What is the mean name length in 1990? In 2003?  Is there a
significant main effect of year?  Indicate exactly where in the output
you find the answers to these questions.

<em>There are two purposes for this exercise. One is for you to see
that random samples from the null hypothesis can exhibit main effects
and interactions, just by chance. A second is for you to see what
significant main effects and interactions look like in the presence of
random data noise, unlike the perfect textbook examples you learn
from.</em>

On the Schedule tab of Oncourse, find the Excel spreadsheet named
TwoFactorANOVA.xls. On its third worksheet (with tab named "Random
data from null hyp."), you will see data randomly sampled from a null
hypothesis, with a two factor ANOVA conducted on the data. This was
also shown in class.

<p>Press F9 a few times to see how cell means can change, just by
chance, when sampled from the null hypothesis. 

<p>A. Press F9 until the row effect is significant but the column and
interaction effects are not significant. Stop! Print one page that
shows the data, ANOVA output, and graph. You will need to print in
landscape orientation, and you might need to squeeze the left columns
and textbox so that the entire ANOVA output table fits on the
page. Next to the graph, write in your own words how the graph depicts
the row effect.

<p>B. Press F9 until the column effect is significant but the row and
interaction effects are not significant. Stop! Print one page that
shows the data, ANOVA output, and graph. You will need to print in
landscape orientation, and you might need to squeeze the left columns
and textbox so that the entire ANOVA output table fits on the
page. Next to the graph, write in your own words how the graph depicts
the column effect.

<p>C. Press F9 until the interaction effect is significant but the
column and row effects are not significant. Stop! Print one page that
shows the data, ANOVA output, and graph. You will need to print in
landscape orientation, and you might need to squeeze the left columns
and textbox so that the entire ANOVA output table fits on the
page. Next to the graph, write in your own words how the graph depicts
the interaction effect.
