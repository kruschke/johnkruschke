<p><strong>Class Time and Place:</strong> Spring semester, 2005
(Section 9885). Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:30-3:45. Psychology
Building, room 226.

<p><strong>Required Textbooks:</strong> 
<li>Aron, Aron & Coups (2005). Statistics for the Behavioral and
Social Sciences: A Brief Course. 3rd
Edition. Pearson/Prentice-Hall. ISBN 0-13-150508-4 (paperback).
<li>Rosenberg (2004). The Excel Statistics
Companion. Wadsworth/Thomson Learning. ISBN 0-534-64230-6 (paperback
with CD).


<p><strong>Other Required Equipment:</strong> <li><em>Excel.</em> We will be
using software called Excel, which is available on all the campus
computers and is also available free to IU students from <a
href="http://iuware.indiana.edu/" target="new">IUware</a> under
"Office Suites" as part of Office 2003.  <li><em>Web pages.</em> There
will be much info posted on the class website:
<tt>http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/K300/</tt>. Please check often!
Grades will be posted on <a href="http://oncourse.iu.edu"
target="new">Oncourse</a>.  <li><em>Calculator.</em> You will find it
very useful to have a calculator, for homeworks and exams. Any
calculator with a square root function should be sufficient. I
recommend a calculator powered by photovoltaic cells, because
batteries have an uncanny knack for dying during exams.



<p><strong>Instructional Goals:</strong>

Inferential statistics are at the foundation of all scientific
knowledge.  Statistical methods are merely ways to make decisions when
we have uncertain information. Because all information in life is
uncertain, and we constantly have to make decisions, statistical
inference permeates life.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my goals for this class is
to motivate your interest in statistical methods.  I will try to
provide many real-world examples that involve issues in which you can
get personally invested. If you have suggestions for application
topics, please do tell me.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another of my goals for the course
is for you to acquire some transferable computer skills, no matter
what field you go into later. To do this, I will have you learn to use
Excel. Many of you will have already used this general-purpose
spreadsheet program, but hopefully you will learn some new facets of
it in this class.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I want to help you learn
core concepts of statistical inference. Fundamental among these
concepts is the notion of a sampling distribution; we will use
computers to simulate the generation of sampling distributions. I will
emphasize the logic of hypothesis testing, and the related notions of
confidence intervals and statistical power. As examples of this logic,
we will study various applications of the <i>t</i>-test and simple
analysis of variance (ANOVA).  (If I had my druthers, I'd teach
Bayesian techniques, too, but I feel obligated to cover classical
statistics first, and there won't be time for Bayesian approaches.)

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Unfortunately we do not have separate
discussion sections or lab sections outside of lecture.  <li>Please do
ask questions in class. <li>Please also discuss questions on the
Oncourse discussion forum. <li>Please alert me to interesting
real-world issues that can be addressed by statistical methods.

<p><strong>Schedule.</strong> A linked page shows each week's topics,
readings, homework assignments, and exam dates. You will see that the
course is split into five segments of about three weeks each. During
each segment there are two homework assignments and an exam.

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> There are regular homework assignments,
one per week except exam weeks, comprising 10 homework assignments
altogether. The schedule page links to the specific assignments. The
homework is your primary means for "hands on" experience with the
concepts, and so doing it is crucial for success in the course!
<li>Homework is due at the <em>beginning</em> of class on the day it
is due. Any homework turned in after the instructor collects it at the
beginning of class is marked late. <li>Late homework submitted to the
Psychology Department Receptionist (behind the window of the Main
Office) by 4:30pm the next day will be accepted but automatically
marked down 20% (in addition to any deductions for errors). Homework
will not be accepted after 4:30pm the day after it is
due. <li>Solutions to the homework will be posted on the web sometime
soon after 4:30pm the day after it is due. <li>Each homework
assignment counts 40 points. <li>Your lowest homework score will not
count toward the computation of your final grade. If you suffer severe
circumstances that interfere with more than one homework assignment,
please discuss your situation with me immediately when the crisis
occurs. If you miss a second homework assignment you must have
documented excuses for <em>both</em> missed assignments.

<p><strong>Exams:</strong> There will be four midterm exams and a
final exam (5 exams altogether), spaced at approximately three week
intervals. See the schedule page for exact dates.  <li>All exams are
mandatory. <li>The final exam is cumulative. The midterm exams will
emphasize material from the most recent part of the course, but the
material is inherently cumulative, so in that sense the midterm exams
are cumulative too.  <li>Calculators are permitted during
exams. <li>Each midterm exam counts 100 points. The final exam counts
160 points.  <li>The lowest of your four midterm exam scores will not
count toward your final grade. (The final exam does count in all
cases.) In particular, if you must miss a midterm exam because of
illness or obligation, that zero will not count toward your grade. If
severe and documented circumstances require that you miss two midterm
exams, contact the instructor immediately, preferably before the
missed exams. Note that if you miss two midterm exams you must have
documented excuses for <em>both</em> exams. In these extremely rare
cases, a make-up exam will be arranged which might be different than
the in-class exam.

<strong>Grading:</strong> Course grades are based on the 9 included
homework scores, the 3 included midterm exam scores, and the final
exam score. No extra credit projects are allowed. Each homework
assignment counts 40 points. Each midterm exam counts 100 points. The
final exam counts 160 points. Thus, there are 9x40 + 3x100 + 160 = 820
points possible. The course letter grade is determined by your
percentage of points obtained in the included homeworks and exams,
according to the table above right.

<p><strong>Important note regarding missed homework and
exams.</strong> The policy regarding dropping the lowest exam and
homework scores is designed to forgive a student for a week or two
during which life just didn't go as smoothly as hoped, and to
accommodate students with genuine emergencies or immovable outside
obligations. Please notice that it would be extremely unwise for you
to try take advantage of the system and just "slack off" for a
homework and an exam. There are two ways that doing so would come back
to haunt you. First, the final exam is cumulative and mandatory, so
you need to study all the material anyway. Second, if you capriciously
consume your allocation of dropped homework or exam, and then an
emergency pops up and you really need to miss a homework or exam, you
are stuck with a ZERO for that missed homework or exam. You will
notice from the table above that losing 40 points for a homework, or
100 points (gasp!) for an exam, would be <em>devastating</em> to your
grade. So even if you're not feeling that you've mastered the material
for a week, it is still best to turn in whatever partial homework you
can and show up for the exams, because even a low score is better than
a zero, and you will probably get to drop that low score anyway if you
stay on top of things the rest of the time.

<p>
<strong>Lecture notes.</strong> Lecture notes are not provided. Much
of the lectures will be interactive presentations of computer
software, or solving of example problems. If you must miss a lecture,
please get notes from a classmate (if they are willing).

<p><strong>Disclaimer.</strong> All information in this syllabus is
subject to change. Changes will be announced in class.
