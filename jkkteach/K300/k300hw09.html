K300 Statistics, Prof. Kruschke
<h3>
Homework 9, Due at the beginning of class, Tuesday April 19, 2005.
<!-- <br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- DO NOT YET DO -->

</h3>

<p>Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work as
appropriate -- an unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations that
mysteriously ends up with the correct numerical answer will
<em>not</em> be given full credit <li>answer every part of every
question (unless instructed otherwise).

<ol>

<p><li>5 pts.  Page 329, #14. Do not use the .01 level; use the .05
level.  And answer this: Why does SS<sub>B</sub> change from part (a)
to part (b), but SS<sub>W</sub> does not?

<p><li>5 pts.  Page 329, #17.  For part (a), just show you work
clearly; do not bother with the exact steps of hypothesis testing. Do
part (b). Do not do part (c).


<p><li>5 pts.
What is the definition of effect size for single-factor ANOVA? Express your answer in words and as a formula that does not explicitly involve n (the sample size per group).

<p><li>5 pts.
Page 329, #18.

<p><li>5 pts.
What are three ways to increase the power of a single-factor ANOVA? (Hint: These are exactly analogous to the three ways to increase power for a t test.)

<p><li>5 pts.
Page 329, #19.


<p><li>5 pts.  For the following three groups of scores, conduct a
one-way ANOVA (a) by hand and (b) in Excel. (c) Estimate the effect
size.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group 2: 1, 3, 5
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group 3: 6, 8, 10

<br>Notice that the sample sizes are not the same in the three groups,
so you will need to use the formulas for F described in class. Show
your work. For your Excel print out, print just one page that includes
the data and the ANOVA results.


<p><li>5 pts.

Suppose we are interested in salaries of associate professors (i.e.,
typically 7-12 years as faculty, post PhD) in various
departments. Below are some data; conduct a oneway ANOVA in Excel,
print out a page showing the data and the ANOVA, and write your
conclusion.
