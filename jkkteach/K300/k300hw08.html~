your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work as

A researcher is interested in the effects of caffeine on how fast
people solve a maze. She gives four randomly selected people a cup of
(caffeinated) coffee, and four other randomly selected people a cup of
de-caffeinated coffee. Then she has each person solve a complex
maze. Here are the duractions, in minutes, for solving the maze:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caffeine: 0.250, 0.200, 0.167, 0.143

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De-caf: 1.000, 0.500, 0.333, 0.250

<br><b>A.</b> Conduct a t-test on the durations, assuming a
non-directional test and a .05 significance level. Do the computations
by hand and show your work, but you do not need to draw the
distributions. Be sure to specify the critical t value and your
conclusion.

<br><b>B.</b> Do the two groups seem to have equal variances of
durations?  Do the durations within each group appear to be
symmetrically distributed, or are they skewed? Should we trust the
conclusion from part A, and why or why not (mention the assumptions
behind the critical t value)?

<br><b>C.</b> Instead of measuring each participant's duration to
complete the maze, the researcher transforms the durations into
speeds. Thus, instead of describing each person's performance as
minutes per maze, she describes each person's performance as mazes per
minute (i.e., the number of equally difficult mazes they would solve
in a minute, if they kept the same pace). For example, a duration of
0.250 minutes per maze is transformed into a speed of 1/0.250 = 4.000
mazes per minute.  Transform every duration above into speed by taking
the reciprocal. Then conduct a t-test on the speeds, assuming a
non-directional test and a .05 significance level. Do the computations
by hand and show your work, but you do not need to draw the
distributions. Be sure to specify the critical t value and your
conclusion..

<br><b>D.</b> Do the two groups seem to have equal variances of
speeds?  Do the speeds within each group appear to be symmetrically
distributed, or are they skewed? Should we trust the conclusion from
part C, and why or why not (mention the assumptions behind the
critical t value)?

A zoologist is studying the sounds produced by two species of bats.
She randomly samples 10 recordings from each of the two species, and
measures the dominant frequency (in Hz) of each sound production.  The
data are as follows:

<pre>
spec_1  spec_2
  4675   38177
 34544   80822
  6634    7708
   518    1212
  6974   46630
 13360    4024
   545   89322
   365     898
   314   32860
  1556    4230
</pre>

<br><b>A.</b> Do the two species differ in the mean dominant frequency of
their sound productions? Conduct a t-test (non-directional, .05
significance) in Excel. Print out a single page that shows the data in
the spreadsheet and the results of test, and be sure to write your
conclusion under the t-test output. Also, be sure to clearly write on
the page what exercise it is for, and <em>please put the page in order
with the other exercises</em>.


<br><b>B.</b> Can we trust the results of the t-test in part A? Why or
why not? (Mention variances, symmetry, and how the critical t value is
generated.)

<br><b>C.</b>The zoologist is actually interested in the effective
<em>pitch</em> (do-re-mi...) of the sound, not the raw frequency of
sound.  To convert to pitch from frequency, just take the logarithm of
frequency. In Excel, use the <tt>ln</tt> function to take the
logarithm: For a number in cell A1, compute its logarithm by typing
"<tt>=ln(A1)</tt>" in cell B1.  Conduct a t-test (non-directional, .05
significance) on the pitches in Excel. Print out a single page that
shows the data in the spreadsheet and the results of test, and be sure
to write your conclusion under the t-test output. Also, be sure to
clearly write on the page what exercise it is for, and <em>please put
the page in order with the other exercises</em>.

<br><b>D.</b> Can we trust the results of the t-test in part C? Why or
why not? (Mention variances, symmetry, and how the critical t value is
generated.)

A researcher is interested in the effects of different kinds of stress
on how well people do on a test. She gives four randomly selected
people some strenuous exercise, and four other randomly selected
people threats of grave consequences if they do poorly. Then she has
each person take the test. Here are the scores, out of 25 possible:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercise: 23, 22, 20, 3

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threats: 21, 4, 2, 1 

<br>The scores do not appear to be normally distributed; in fact, they
appear to be bimodal, with some people responding well to stress and
other people reacting badly. The researcher believes that a standard
t-test is inappropriate because of the non-normality, and decides to
use resampling instead.

<p>In Oncourse, go to the Schedule tab (<em>not</em> the In
Touch / Group Spaces tab) and get the Excel spreadsheet for
resampling. Type in the scores for the two groups. Press F9 a few
times so that you see how the values change with different random
samplings, and stop pressing F9 when the result looks typical. 



<br><b>A.</b> For the Null Hypothesis worksheet, briefly state how the
numbers in cells B4 and F4 are generated.



<br><b>B.</b> Does the null hypothesis sampling distribution have a
single mode like the t distributions we have seen for sampling from
normal distributions? 


<br><b>C.</b> What is the critical t value, in the re-sampled t
distribution, on the high (positive) end of the distribution? [Hint:
it will be close to, but not exactly equal to, the t value for a
normal population.]

<br><b>D.</b> Does the actual data t value exceed the critical t value
in the re-sampled t distribution? Should the researcher reject the
null hypothesis that the two types of stress have equal effects?


<br><b>E.</b> For the Alternative Hypothesis worksheet, briefly state how the
numbers in cells B4 and F4 are generated.

<br><b>F.</b> On the Alternative Hypothesis worksheet, press F9 until
typical values appear. Does the alternative hypothesis sampling
distribution have a single mode like the t distributions we have seen
for sampling from normal distributions?



<br><b>G.</b> Under the alternative hypothesis, what is the
probability that the re-sampled t will exceed the critical value from
the null hypothesis?
