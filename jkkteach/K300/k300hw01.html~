K300 Statistics, Prof. Kruschke
<h3>
Homework 1, Due at the beginning of class, Tuesday January 18, 2005.
</h3>

Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>annotate your
computations -- an unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations
that mysteriously ends up with the correct numerical answer will
<em>not</em> be given full credit <li>answer every part of every
question.

<ol>

<li>5 pts. According to the syllabus,
<ul>
<li>How many points should this homework be worth?  <li>If you were to
turn in this homework on the Thursday after it is due, how many points
would you get? <li>If you decided not to do this homework or the next
one, and had no documented emergency to excuse them, would both zeros
count toward your final grade?
</ul>

<li>6 pts.  Page 25, #9. For each distribution, be sure to mention
three aspects: Number of modes, skewness, and kurtosis.

<li>6 pts. Work through Rosenberg's Excel sheet, <tt>1-5 Practice
Describing Data</tt>. For this homework, print out and turn in
<em>only</em> the "Practice" sheet (not the "Intro" sheet, etc.) with
the summary stats filled in and the histogram showing.

<li>7 pts.  Page 27, #19. Do this by hand, then repeat parts a, b, c
and d in Excel. (Print out your Excel spreadsheet with graphs.)

<li>6 pts. Page 55, #12.

<li>6 pts. Page 55, #13. Do this by hand, then repeat in Excel. For
the Excel print-out, annotate exactly the functions and procedures you
used.


<li>4 pts. Suppose a person has entered data into an Excel
spreadsheet, using column C from rows 3 to 211 (inclusive). <ul>
<li>She wants to determine the mean of the data. Would she be correct
to type into an empty cell this formula:
<tt>=SUM(C3:C211)/COUNT(C3:C211)</tt> ?  <li>She wants to determine
the mean of the data. Would she be correct to type into an empty cell
this formula: <tt>=AVERAGE(C3:C211)</tt> ?  <li>She wants to detemine
the standardized score for the first datum. Would she be correct to
type into an empty cell this formula:
<tt>=(C3-AVERAGE(C3:C211))/STDEVP(C3:C211)</tt> ?  <li>She wants to
detemine the standardized score for the first datum. Would she be
correct to type into an empty cell this formula:
<tt>=(C3-AVERAGE(C3:C211))/STDEV(C3:C211)</tt> ?
</ul>


</ol>
