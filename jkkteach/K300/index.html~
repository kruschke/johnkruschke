<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong>

Inferential statistics are at the foundation of all scientific
knowledge. Some would argue that statistical inference is the root of
all human knowledge of any sort: We are all intuitive
statisticians. Statistical methods are merely ways to make decisions
when we have uncertain information. Because all information in life is
uncertain, and we constantly have to make decisions, statistical
inference permeates life.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this class I'd like you to help motivate your interest in this
topic. I'll try to do this two ways. First, I'll try to provide lots
of real-world examples. Second, I'll try to make the applications
things that you can get personally invested in. Hopefully you'll
actually care enough about some of the real-world examples that you'll
want to know how statistical methods help decide them.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this class I'd like you to acquire some transferable computer
skills, no matter what field you go into later. To do this, I'll have
you learn to use Excel. Many of you will have already used this
general-purpose spreadsheet program, but hopefully you'll learn some
new facets of it in this class.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of course I want to help you learn core concepts of statistical
inference. Fundamental among these concepts is the notion of a
sampling distribution; we will use computers to simulate the
generation of a lot of sampling distributions. I will emphasize the
logic of hypothesis testing, and the related notions of confidence
intervals and statistical power. As examples of this logic, we'll
study various applications of the t-test and simple ANOVA. If there is
time, we'll also touch on chi-square tests. (If I had my druthers, I'd
teach Bayesian techniques, too, but I feel obligated to cover
classical statistics first, and there won't be time for Bayesian
extensions.)
