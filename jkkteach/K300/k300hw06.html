Homework 6, Due at the beginning of class, Tuesday Mar. 8, 2005.


</h3>

<p>Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work as
appropriate -- an unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations that
mysteriously ends up with the correct numerical answer will
<em>not</em> be given full credit <li>answer every part of every
question (unless instructed otherwise).

<ol>

<li> 4 pts. 
P. 252, #13. 
Do not do part (c). 


<li> 4 pts. 
p. 253, #16.
Do not do part (c). 


<li> 4 pts. 
p. 253, #17.
Do not do part (c). 


<li> 2 pts. 
p. 254, #19.
Hints: S is the sqrt of S<sup>2</sup> in Eqn. 8-1, p. 221. See p. 240.


<li> 3 pts. 
p. 254, #20, (a)-(f), that is, not (g). Hint: See Table 8-8, p. 241.


<li> 3 pts. 
p. 254, #21. Hint: See Table 8-9, p. 242. 


<li> 5 pts.  Rosenberg Workbook 6-1. Read through the sheets, and
then do the exercise on the sheet "experiment". Print out the first
page of the "experiment" sheet, such that your Sample 3 and Sample 4
are shown, along with the average, stdevp and stdev of your
samples. Make sure to answer the question of which is closer to the
true SD!


<li> There are three Excel workbooks in the Group Space of
Oncourse that begin with K300HW6_... Get them and open them in
Excel. Carefully follow the instructions in each one and then do the
following:


First do the workbook with "_Neq4_" in the name, then "_Neq9_",
and then finally "_nonnormal". For each one, print out <em>only</em>
the graph of the sampling distribution and the last page, showing the
percentiles and critical values in the sampling distribution. (No need
to waste a lot of trees!) Keep them collated, in order.

<br><b>A. 9 pts.</b> On the print outs of the three "SamplingAttributes"
pages, neatly write answers to the three Stop and Think
questions. Hopefully you can find space on your piece of paper; if
not, attach an extra sheet with clear indications of which questions
you're answering.



<br><b>B. 6 pts.</b> On the print outs of the sampling distributions,
<i>clearly mark</i> the locations the 2.5th %ile and the 97.5th %ile
(which are computed on the SamplingAttributes sheet). If they lie off
the edge of the graph, indicate that, with their approximate
locations.
