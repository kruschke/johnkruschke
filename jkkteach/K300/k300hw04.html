Homework 4, Due at the beginning of class, Tuesday Feb. 15, 2005.


</h3>

<p>The Excel project (last exercise) will be discussed extensively in
class on Thursday Feb 10.

<p>Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work as
appropriate -- an unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations that
mysteriously ends up with the correct numerical answer will
<em>not</em> be given full credit <li>answer every part of every
question (unless instructed otherwise).

<ol>

<li> 2 pts. Page 180, #12.

<li> 4 pts. Page 180-181, #13, cases (a), (d), (e) and (f) only.

<li> 6 pts. Page 181, #15, cases (a) and (c) only.

<li> 4 pts. Page 182, #19, but do NOT do part (d).

<li> 4 pts. Page 182, #21, but do NOT do part (d).


<li> 5 pts.

<em>Rosenberg Excel worksheet 4-2.</em> Work through to the sheet
labeled "<b>your data (n=9)</b>". 
<ul>
<li>Before following the instructions on that sheet, make the
following correction: Notice in cell B18 the formula is
=AVERAGE(B9:B17). That is correct; the numbers in row 18 should be the
means of the 9 numbers above them. But in all the subsequent columns,
the formula is entered incorrectly. For example, in column C the
formula in cell C18 is =AVERAGE(C10:C17) but it should be
=AVERAGE(C9:C17). To fix this error, select cell B18, then drag the
lower right corner of the selection box over all the highlighted cells
to its right in row 18.

<li>Now follow the instructions on the worksheet, but for the random
number seed, use the last four digits of your student ID number.

<li>Print just the first page of that sheet (not all 50 columns), so we
can see the mean of the sample means and the SD of the sample means.
</ul>

<li> 15 pts.

<em>Excel project: Sampling distribution of the mean.</em> This is
much like the Rosenberg spreadsheet in the previous exercise, but laid
out differently. Variations of this spreadsheet will be used in future
homework assignments. So work carefully on this now to make future
assignments easier.

<ul>
<li>Get the spreadsheet from the Oncourse Group Space, "Excel
Spreadsheets". The name of the file is K300HW4_SampDistMean_Blank.xls.
<li><em>Carefully</em> follow the directions displayed in the
worksheets. Notice that there are five sheets in the workbook. Do all
five.  <li>Print out one page for each of the four worksheets for
which you have to type in formulas or make graphs, so we can see that
the columns begin correctly and that the graphs are correct. You might
have to use landscape orientation when you print. <li>The worksheets
have several "Stop and Think!" questions, numbered consecutively
1-15. Write answers to these questions neatly on a separate page.
