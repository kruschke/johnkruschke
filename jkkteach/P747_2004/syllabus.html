Syllabus (very rough, under construction)
</h2>
<h3>
P747 Modeling Methods, Prof. John K. Kruschke
</h3>

<p>
The primary goal of the course is to systematically learn about the
many issues in model fitting and comparison, from the basics of
parameter estimation and computer techniques for function
minimization, to sophisticated issues of model selection and
comparison.

<p>
Our main route through the material will be the textbook,
<a href="http://www.oup-usa.org/isbn/0340740418.html" target="_blank">
Morgan, B. J. T. (2000). <em>Applied Stochastic Modelling</em>. New
York: Oxford University Press.</a> We will frequently take side roads
in the form of specific articles that provide alternative perspectives
or more information on specialized topics.

<p>
Because this is a seminar course with a relatively small enrollment,
the exact topics and timing will be very responsive to the interests
and comprehension of the students (and the instructor!).
