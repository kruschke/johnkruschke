P533/P534 Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis I &amp; II.
<br><br>Spring 2011: Mondays and Wednesdays, 5:45pm-8:15pm, 
<br>Room 111 of the Psychology Building.  
<br><br>P533 and P534 are consecutive 8-week courses
in one semester. Each is 3 credits. P533 is Section 28493, P534 is
Section 13685. P533 is required for P534. </h2>

<p> P533/P534 is a tutorial introduction to doing Bayesian statistics
for data analysis. In P533, we start from the basics of probabilities
and Bayes' theorem, and gradually work our way through contemporary
Monte Carlo methods in the context of simple analyses, building up to
hierarchical models, model comparison, and power analysis. In P534, we
do a variety of realistic applications, covering the Bayesian versions
of linear regression, logistic regression, t-tests, analysis of
variance, etc., including a look at repeated measures designs. More
details about topic coverage is provided below. The course is intended
to make advanced Bayesian methods genuinely accessible to real
graduate students, and even unreal undergraduates (see pre-req's
below). Many complete computer programs are provided for you do adapt
to your own research.

<b>
Why should we do Bayesian analysis instead of
20th century null hypothesis significance testing?</b> Read
<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2010WIRES.pdf"
target="new">THIS</a>
and <a

target="new">THIS</a>.

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> <li>This is <i>not</i> a mathematical
statistics course, but some math is unavoidable. If you can handle
basic summation notation like &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> x<sub>i</sub> and
integral notation like &int;&nbsp;x&nbsp;dx, you're in good shape. You
will not need to generate mathematical derivations.

<li>We will be doing a lot of computer programming in a language
called R. R is free and can be installed on any computer. (We will be
using a free add-on package called BRugs that only works with Windows,
but which you can run with WINE in MacOS or Linux.) The road to
understanding will be much smoother if you have already had some
programming experience, in any language. It's easy to learn basic
programming, but it can be time consuming, so if you don't have any
previous experience, just anticipate spending more time. Learning to
program can have huge payoffs in multiple situations later in your
career, so it's worth the effort.

<li>A previous course in traditional statistics (such as K300) or
probability can be helpful as background, but is not
essential. P533 and P534 proceed independently of traditional
("null hypothesis significance testing") statistical methods.

<b>Topics covered, in a little more detail:</b> P533 emphasizes the
simplest data situation: two-valued measurements such as yes/no,
agree/disagree, remember/forget, detect/miss, male/female,
heads/tails, and so on. The main goal is to use this simple situation
to develop all the methods of contemporary Bayesian analysis,
including hierarchical models and even the
impress-your-friends-with-this "transdimensional Markov chain Monte
Carlo" method for model comparison! P534 applies the
methods to more complex data designs, corresponding to classical
methods of multiple linear regression, logistic regression, t-tests,
analysis of variance, etc.

<p>P533 Topics:

<ol>

<li> Models, parameters, beliefs. Intro to the R programming language.

<li> Probability: Inside and outside the head. Mass and
density. Conditional probabilities.

<li> Bayes' theorem. Three goals of statistical inference.

<li> Inferring a binomial proportion via exact mathematical analysis
(easy, honest!).

<li> Inferring a binomial proportion via grid approximation.

<li> Inferring a binomial proportion via Monte Carlo
approximation. <em>The Metropolis algorithm</em>.

<li> Inferences regarding <em>two</em> binomial proportions. This
motivates our first look at <em>Gibbs sampling</em>.

"BUGS" software.

<li> Hierarchical modeling and <em>model comparison</em>.

<li> Goals, power, and sample size, i.e., <em>research design</em> from a

significance testing.

</ol>

<p><b>Discussion:</b>
Please discuss the assignments and lectures on <a
href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/" target="new">Oncourse</a> under the
"Forums" link.  If you are attending the class but cannot get access
to the Oncourse page, please e-mail Prof. Kruschke.

<p><b>Grading; Homework; Exams:</b> There are homework exercises
assigned every week or so. No exams or projects. Grades will be
determined by performance on the homework assignments. All assignments
are mandatory. There will be penalties for late homework unless you
have a cogent excuse. These penalties are designed as an incentive to
you because the material is cumulative; the penalties also help keep
things fair to all students. If you must be late with an assignment,
please notify the professor <i>immediately</i>.

<p><b>How does this course (P533/P534) differ from S626?</b> The
Dept. of Statistics offers S626, Bayesian theory and data analysis.
S626 has a prerequisite of "two statistics courses at the graduate
level", and provides a mathematical treatment of Bayesian data
analysis.  Students are encouraged to consider S626 after taking
P533/P534.


<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> All the information here is subject to
change. Changes will announced in class.
