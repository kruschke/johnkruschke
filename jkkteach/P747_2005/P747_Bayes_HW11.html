P747 Bayesian Stats, Prof. Kruschke
<br>
Homework 11, Due Wednesday Dec. 7, 2005.

<!--
<br><strong>UNDER CONSTRUCTION! DO NOT YET DO!</strong>

<font size="-1">
<p>General directions:

<li>
Make a cover sheet, without any answers, that has your name and
student ID number (not your SS number). On all subsequent sheets, that
have your answers, write only your student ID number (not your SS
number, and not your name).

<li>
Make a photocopy of your homework, and hand in the original and the
photocopy. (Of course, you might want to keep another copy for
yourself!) The copy, with the cover page removed, will be used for
peer-grading.

<li>
Include your complete R program. Make sure it is well commented, so
that the reader knows why each line of code is there.

In this homework we compare null hypothesis significance testing
(NHST) with Bayesian analysis. The domain of application is coin
flipping, wherein we measure a two category outcome (heads or
tails). We flip the coin N=20 times and get r=6 heads. We are
interested in two hypotheses: One hypothesis is that the coin is fair
with the probability of heads being <em>p</em>=.50; the other
hypothesis is that the coin is biased to come up heads only
<em>p</em>=.25. These hypotheses are formalized in more detail below.


<ol>

<li>NHST.



<p><em>A. Test the null hypothesis.</em> Can the null hypothesis
(<em>p</em>=.50) be rejected? Assume a non-directional null
hypothesis, i.e., a two-tailed test, with Type I error rate set at
5%. In other words, is the probability of getting just 6 or fewer
heads less than 2.5%?

<p><em>B. Determine the confidence interval.</em> What is the range of
values for <em>p</em> that could not be rejected? (Again, using a
two-tailed test with Type I error rate of 5%.)

<p><em>C. Compute the power.</em> For an alternative hypothesis of
<em>p</em>=.25, what is the power of the test? That is, if the
alternative hypothesis is true, what is the probability of rejecting
the null hypothesis?




<p><li>Bayesian analysis.



<p><em>A. Determine the credible interval.</em> Suppose the prior on
<em>p</em> is Beta(1,1). Notice that the prior is uniform, with mean
<em>p</em>=.50, so this is one possible expression of a "null"
hypothesis.  <br>* What is the 95% posterior credible interval?
(Define the credible interval as on the bottom of p.38 of our
textbook; i.e., the region of highest posterior density. One way to
find this is with the "rising tide method" used in class.)  <br>* How
does the credible interval compare with the confidence interval found
in NHST (larger, smaller, overlapping)?  <br>* Does the credible
interval contain <em>p</em>=.50?  <br>Now answer these three questions
again, using a prior of Beta(10,10), which also is a reasonable
expression of a "null" hypothesis.


<p><em>B. Compare null and alternative hypotheses.</em> Consider the
following two hypotheses. The null hypothesis, H0, supposes a prior of
Beta(10,10). The alternative, H1, supposes a prior of Beta(5,15).
<br>* What is the mean of the H0 prior? What is the mean of the H1
prior?  <br>* With r=6 and N=20, determine the Bayes factor
p(r|H1)/p(r|H0).  <br>* Suppose that H1 is true; i.e., coins are
minted with flipping probabilities as described by H1. Generate random
values of <em>p</em> from H1, and for each <em>p</em> generate a
random value of r and compute the Bayes factor p(r|H1)/p(r|H0). Do
that enough times so that a histogram of the Bayes factors is fairly
stable. Show the histogram. What is the probability that the Bayes
factor is greater than 1.0? What is the probability that the Bayes
factor is greater than 20.0?  <br>Answer these three questions again,
using H0: Beta(1,1) and H1: Beta(50,150).

<p>Post Script: We will not pursue the topic of <em>sample size
determination</em> in this homework, but it follows from the questions
above. In NHST, sample size is determined by power: We determine the
minimal N that yields the desired power. In Bayesian analysis, sample
size is determined in various ways, but one approach is to determine
the minimal N that yields a desired probability of the Bayes factor
being greater than, say, 20.0. See: Weiss, R. (1997). Bayesian sample
size calculations for hypothesis testing. The Statistician, v.46, n.2,
pp.185-191.
