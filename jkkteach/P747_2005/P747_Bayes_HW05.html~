P747 Bayesian Stats, Prof. Kruschke
<br>
Homework 5, Due Wednesday Oct 5, 2005.
<!--
<br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
-->

<p>General directions:

<li>
Make a cover sheet, without any answers, that has your name and
student ID number (not your SS number). On all subsequent sheets, that
have your answers, write only your student ID number (not your SS
number, and not your name).

<li>
Make a photocopy of your homework, and hand in the original and the
photocopy. (Of course, you might want to keep another copy for
yourself!) The copy, with the cover page removed, will be used for
peer-grading.

<li>
Show your work. When solving applied problems, first express the
solution or method in terms of general formulas, then plug in specific
numbers to get a specific numerical solution. Annotate the progression
of calculations so that a reader can understand why you are doing what
you are doing.



<p>
For this assignment, it will be useful to know the basics of the Gamma
function (which appears in Equations 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 in the
textbook). You can find a discussion of the Gamma function in the
Wikipedia at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function</a>. 

In R, the function <tt>gamma</tt> returns the value of the gamma
function. In R, type <tt>help("gamma")</tt> for information about the
gamma function. You can generate a graph of the Gamma function that is
much like the first diagram in the Wikipedia article by typing the
following commands into R:

<tt>
<br> x <- seq( from = -5.005 ,to = 5.005 ,by = 0.01 )
<br> y <- gamma( x )
<br> plot( x ,y ,type="l" ,ylim=c(-5,5) ,col="red" )
</tt>

<p>
<ol>
Please do the following:

<p><li>Carefully derive Equations 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 in the
textbook. Annotate the steps of your derivation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hint:</em> When working on the
factor p(theta|alpha,beta,y), you will find it useful to review the
discussion on p. 40 of the textbook.

<p><li>Create R code that generates a graph just like Figure 5.3(a),
p. 130 of the textbook. This is only asking for Figure 5.3(a), not
Figure 5.3(b). <em>Also include a plot of the 95% confidence region,
which Figure 5.3(a) does not have</em>.  Use a grid step of 0.01 on
log(alpha/beta), and of 0.05 on log(alpha+beta). Carefully comment
your code and hand it in, along with the graph.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hints:</em> The authors define the prior
density in terms of alpha,beta, but use a grid defined on
log(alpha/beta),log(alpha+beta). So to determine the prior density at
any point on the grid, you have to convert grid values to alpha,beta
values. Verify that for a point x,y on the grid, alpha =
e^x*e^y/(1+e^x) and beta = e^y/(1+e^x).  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
authors use a range on log(alpha+beta) that goes from 1.0 to 5.0. I
find that high values in that range cause overflow errors. So just use
a range of 1.0 to 4.5 if you run into that
problem. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rat tumor data are available from
the author's web site,
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/data/rats.asc

<p><li>Find and report the values of alpha and beta that maximize the
posterior distribution of Figure 5.3(a). Make a plot of the
corresponding posterior distribution of theta; i.e.,
p(theta|alpha@max,beta@max,y).  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hints:</em>
You might find that there are two or more points at which the
posterior is maximized, and so the array of indices returned by
<tt>which</tt> has multiple rows. If so, be careful how you read out
the values from that array.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
