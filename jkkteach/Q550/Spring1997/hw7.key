One output node.

In this case the single output node wins every pattern, and so moves
closer to the presented input on every trial.  How much closer depends
on the lrate.
 
          lrate=1.0   lrate=0.5      lrate=0.05
input     Weights     Weights        Weights
100       1 0 0       .57 .14 .28    .34 .31 .33
010       0 1 0       .28 .57 .14    .33 .34 .31
001       0 0 1       .14 .28 .57    .31 .33 .34

At asymptote, the weights are oscillating, pursuing the cycle of input
patterns.  For the lowest learning rate, the magnitude of the
oscillation is small, so that the weight vector nearly settles on the
over mean of the input patterns.


Two output nodes.

In this case, one node wins one input and the other node wins the
other two input patterns.
 
lrate=1.0
Weights stable for one output, but oscillated for other
1 0 0     0 0 1
          0 1 0
          0 0 1
 
lrate=0.5
Weights stable for one output, but oscillated for other
.99 0 0   0 .33 .66
          0 .66 .33
          0 .33 .66
 
lrate=0.05
Weights stable for one output, but oscillated for other
.98 0 0   0 .48 .51
          0 .51 .48

The weights tend toward the means of the input patterns they win.  For
the node that wins two input patterns, the weights oscillated in
pursuit of the oscillating cycle of inputs, but just for the two
inputs it wins.  The magnitude of oscillation depends on the learning
rate.


Three output nodes. 

In almost all cases, each output node was associated with one input
pattern.
 
lrate=1.0
Weights stable for all three outputs
1 0 0		0 1 0		0 0 1
 
lrate=0.5
Weights stable for all three outputs
.99 0 0		0 .99 0		0 0 .99
 
lrate=0.05
In some cases one output node would remain unused because its initial
random weights never allowed it to win a competition.  Otherwise
weights stable for all three outputs.
.99 0 0		0 .99 0 	0 0 .99

Again, each cluster node heads toward the mean of the inputs it wins.
In this case, each node won just one pattern, so it perfectly matched
that pattern (to within rounding error).
