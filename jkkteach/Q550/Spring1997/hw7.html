<p><strong>1. Types of maps. (6 pts.)</strong> 

<p>Chapter 10 of Anderson discusses Nelson and Bower's (1990) taxonomy
of cortical maps.  Which of N&B's three types is the map in Figure
14.7? Figure 14.13?  Figure 14.15?  Figure 14.16? Figure 14.17? Figure
14.19?


<p><strong>2. Only-winner-learns vs. neighbors-learn-too. (5
pts.)</strong> 

<p>In describing the formation of adaptive ("Kohonen") maps, on p.469
Anderson states that "using a very large initial neighborhood seems to
be essential for proper formation of the maps."  Briefly describe what
would happen if the system began with (and forever thereafter used) an
excitatory neighborhood with radius <em>zero</em>, so that only the
winner learns.

<p><strong>3. Competitive learning in program <tt>cl</tt> (9 pts.)</strong>

<p>Use the files provided below to explore the behavior of competitive
learning under the influences of (i) the number of output nodes and
(ii) the learning rate.  In this exercise there are three input nodes,
and the patterns represent single "features" in the input.  The
patterns are presented cyclically, using <tt>strain</tt>.

<p>Your job is to <tt>strain</tt> the network for three different
learning rates and three different numbers of output (cluster) nodes.
Use learning rates of 1.0, 0.5 or 0.05, and 1, 2 or 3 output nodes.
For each of the nine combinations, <tt>strain</tt> the network and
describe the asymptotic behavior of the weights.  Briefly explain why
these behaviors occur, in terms of the mechanisms of competitive
learning.

<p>Hints: You can use the same template file for all runs.  For a
given number of output nodes, you can change the learning rate by
typing <tt>set param lrate</tt> on the command line (and then don't
forget to <tt>reset</tt>).  To change the number of output nodes, quit
the program, change the <tt>set config noutputs</tt> line in the the
start-up file, and re-invoke the program.
