<ul>

<p><li><strong>Email is preferred.</strong> Send homeworks in ASCII
format by email to mscheutz@indiana.edu Write in the subject line:
Q550-<em>homework number</em>, so my automated mailing system will
file them correctly. If possible, don't use attachments (as it is more
complicated to include them in replies if I need to comment on your
answers).

<p><li><strong>Type your homeworks if possible</strong>, otherwise,
please, write legibly and with clear organization. It is in your best
interest, if I can read your arguments.

<p><li><strong>Don't turn in screenshots of single epochs of
training</strong>.  Turn in only the results (if so indicated).  Try
to be succinct and short in your answer, but elaborte it where
necessary (e.g., if the question asks to describe the difference of
two networks, take your time to include all essential differences,
also explaining why they differ).

<p><li><strong>If a problem consists of a "Yes/no" together with a "Why
or why not?"  question, please, state your answer (yes or no) clearly
and then give the arguments supporting it.</strong> I will from now on
look in particular for analytical arguments that rely on the
functionality (i.e., the math) of the network.  General answers such
as "The network could not learn the problem, because the data did not
permit it" will not earn credit!
