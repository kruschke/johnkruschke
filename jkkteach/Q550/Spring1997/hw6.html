<p><strong>1. Simulated annealing in Hopfield networks. (6 pts.)</strong>
Consider the network described in the Anderson textbook on pp.422+.
Consider the equation for energy described in the book on pp.408 and
423.

<p>Show that the energy of state (a) in Figure Figure 12.19, p.425,
equals the energy in state (b).  (Hint: You only need to consider the
energy of five nodes.)

<p>Show that the energy of state (c) is greater than that of state
(d). (Hint: Again, you only need to consider five nodes.)

<p><strong>2. Stability in lateral inhibition networks. (4 pts.)</strong>

<p>Consider the equation on p.108 for determining the values of weights
in a lateral inhibition network.  Are the weights between two nodes
symmetric?

<p>At the bottom of p.113, Anderson appeals to a theorem of Kreysig to
argue that the lateral inhibition network will stabilize.  Instead,
assume that the output function of the nodes is a +1/-1 sigmoid (very
similar to the "minor nonlinearity" described on p.114). Will the
lateral inhibition network stabilize? (Hint: Apply Hopfield's
theorem.)

<p><strong>3. BSB network. (15 pts.)</strong> Construct a graph
similar to that in Figure 15.3 (p.505), as follows:

<p>First, construct a weight matrix, A, from the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues shown in Figure 15.3, by using the equation in the middle
of the page on p.499.  Show that method really does generate the
"feedback matrix" in Fig.15.3.

<p>Second, generate some trajectories of activations, as follows.  Use
the equation at the bottom of p.504, with gamma=0.9, alpha=0.5, and
delta=1.0.  Generate the first five steps when starting with
activation 0.55,0.25; and, generate the first five steps when starting
with activation 0.4,0.4.  Draw a graph of the two trajectories,
similar to Figure 15.3.  Which starting point reaches a stable
point sooner?


<p><strong>4. Prototypes and instances in the CS network. (15
pts.)</strong>

<p>Use the Jets & Sharks files supplied with the <tt>cs</tt> program.
(Unfortunately, program <tt>cs</tt> is not working properly on
Copper, so you must use a PC or Mac to do this exercise.)

<p>Look at the list (Figure 1) on p.39 of PDP III, and determine the
modal prototypical features for the Jets and for the Sharks.  That is,
for each of the four features -- age, education, marital status, and
occupation -- determine which value occurs most often for the Jets,
and which value occurs most often for Sharks. Report these values.
<em>For some features, there is not a unique mode.  In this case, any
of the modal values counts as prototypical.</em>

<p>Look at the list (Figure 1) on p.39 of PDP III, and determine the
feature values of Ken.  Report these values.  Notice that Ken is the
only instance with both "Sharks" and "in20s".

<p>Edit the file "jets.net" so that v = -15.0 and h = -10.0. (What do
you think "v" and "h" stand for?  I suspect it has something to do
with whether or not the outside world can see those nodes.)  Then
invoke the <tt>cs</tt> program using <tt>jets.tem</tt> and
<tt>jets.str</tt>.  Set ncycle to 100.

<p><strong>Prototypes.</strong>

<p>Clamp on the "Jets" node. (That is, set input of Jets to 1.)

<p>Do the following fifteen times:
<ol>
<li>newstart
<li>cycle
<li>Count and record how many features -- name, education, marital
status, and occupation -- match the prototypical values of Jets.
</ol>
After fifteen of these runs, compute the mean number of feature
matches to the prototypical Jet.

<p>Now repeat the fifteen runs using h = 0.0. (So there are 30 runs
total.)  Report the results, including the mean number of feature
matches to the Jets prototype.

<p><strong>Instances.</strong>

<p>Change h back to -10. Clamp on both the "Sharks" and "in20s" nodes.
(Unclamp the Jets node. You might have to specify Sharks and in20s by
node numbers, 1 and 2, instead of by node labels, because the label
for "in20s" doesn't match "20s" on the screen.)

<p>Do the following fifteen times:
<ol>
<li>newstart
<li>cycle
<li>Count and record how many features -- name, education, marital
status, and occupation -- match the values of Ken.
</ol>
After fifteen of these runs, compute the mean number of feature
matches to Ken.

<p>Now repeat the fifteen runs using h = 0.0. (So there are 30 runs
total.)  Report the results, including the mean number of feature
matches to Ken.

<p>Describe how the completions generated by the network depend on the
value of "h".  Which value of "h" is best for generating accurate
reconstructions of the Ken instance?  Which value of "h" is best for
constructing a prototype?  Why or how does "h" have this effect?

<p>Very briefly discuss whether or not the Jets and Sharks network can
be used to retrieve instances and generate prototypes at the same
time.
