Q550 Homework 7: Competitive Learning.

Due Thursday, April 27.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

Use the files provided below to explore the influences of (i) the
number of output nodes and (ii) the learning rate, on the behavior of
competitive learning.  In this exercise there are three input nodes,
and the patterns represent single "features" in the input.  The
patterns are presented cyclically, using "strain."

Your job is to "strain" the network for three different learning rates
and three different numbers of output (cluster) nodes.  Use learning
rates of 1.0, 0.5 or 0.05, and 1, 2 or 3 output nodes.  For each of
the nine combinations, "strain" the network and describe the
asymptotic behavior of the weights.  Briefly explain why it occurs, in
terms of the mechanisms of competitive learning.

Hints: You can use the same template file for all runs.  For a given
number of output nodes, you can change the learning rate by typing
"set param lrate" on the command line (and then don't forget to
"reset").  To change the number of output nodes, quit the program,
change the "set config noutputs" line in the the start-up file, and
re-invoke the program.
