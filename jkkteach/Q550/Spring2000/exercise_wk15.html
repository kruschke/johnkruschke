<p>SnS pp.47-48: 
<br>1.2 (give three examples, not "as many as you can"), 
<br>1.5 and
<br>1.7.  

<p>And answer this: What is Gallistel's point in asking
questions 1.5 and 1.7? 

<p>Finally, address the following: In the last paragraph of the
chapter, Gallistel says, "I have argued that it is difficult to
imagine how any system that did not store and retrieve the values of
variables and apply to them all of the operations in the system of
arithmetic could do [navigation]" Does this argument also apply to
falling objects?  Do falling objects compute their trajectories?  Why
or why not?  Consider, for example, the following question, closely
analogous to Gallistel's question 1.5: If you roll a marble off a
table top near the surface of the earth, such that the marble has a
horizontal velocity of 0.5 meter/sec just as it reaches the edge, what
will be the position of the ball 2 seconds after leaving the table?
Use the equation derived back in the <a href="gravmodel.html">notes
about Newton</a>, from the first week of class. <em>Please limit your
answer to 1 page maximum!</em>
