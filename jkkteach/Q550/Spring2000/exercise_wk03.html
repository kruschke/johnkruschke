<p><li>Suppose that items in the display are letters that vary in case
and character, being either x, o, X or O.  Suppose that the target is
X.  Consider the following eight displays (the following table is in a
format similar to Table 10.3 of the textbook):

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><th colspan=17>Balanced Displays</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Display Size:</th>
<th colspan=4>2</th>
<th colspan=4>4</th>
<th colspan=4>6</th>
<th colspan=4>8</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Target:</th>
<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>
<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>
<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>
<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Form:</th>
<th>x</th><th>o</th><th>x</th><th>o</th>
<th>x</th><th>o</th><th>x</th><th>o</th>
<th>x</th><th>o</th><th>x</th><th>o</th>
<th>x</th><th>o</th><th>x</th><th>o</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Uppercase</th>
<td>1</td><td>1</td> <td>0</td><td>1</td> <td>1</td><td>2</td> <td>0</td><td>2</td>
<td>1</td><td>3</td> <td>0</td><td>3</td> <td>1</td><td>4</td> <td>0</td><td>4</td>

</tr>

<p>(A.) Suppose that selection is always for uppercase items (X or O)
regardless of instructions or numerousity.  Plot the predictions of
the selective search model for the eight displays. Suppose that the
time to process an item (beta) is 20 msec, and the time to press a
button (alpha, either present or absent) is 50 msec.

<p>(B.) Suppose that selection is always for X's (uppercase or
lowercase) regardless of instructions or numerousity.  Plot the
predictions of the selective search model for the eight
displays. Suppose that the time to process an item (beta) is 20 msec,
and the time to press a button (alpha, either present or absent) is 50
msec.

<p>Now consider the following eight displays, and redo parts (A) and
(B) in new graphs.

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><th colspan=17>Unbalanced Displays</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Display Size:</th>
<th colspan=4>2</th>
<th colspan=4>4</th>
<th colspan=4>6</th>
<th colspan=4>8</th>

<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>
<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>
<th colspan=2>Present</th><th colspan=2>Absent</th>

<p><li>10.3 (p.518).  The idea here is that the search <em>always</em>
selects the feature with the least numerous distractors; i.e., it's
<em>not</em> probabilistic. Nevertheless, the selection <em>time</em>
is not constant for some reason.  What's a plausible reason?  (Hint:
maybe it takes time to suppress attention to unselected items, and the
more items there are, the longer it takes.  Suppose the suppression
time is linear, i.e., gamma times the number of items to be
suppressed, where gamma is a new parameter.)  Write the equation for
predicted RT under this model, and plot the predictions for reasonable
parameter values.

<p><li>Consider the <strong>guided search model</strong> applied to these
displays (the target is an upper case X):

<pre>
  +-------+ +-------+ 
  |  O    | |  x    |  
  |    x  | | O    O| 
  |   O   | |   X x | 
  |     X | | x     | 
  |  x    | |   O   | 
  +-------+ +-------+ 

  +-------+ +-------+ 
  |  o    | |  x    |  
  |    x  | | o    o| 
  |   o   | |   X x | 
  |     X | | x     | 
  |  x    | |   o   | 
  +-------+ +-------+ 
</pre>

The top row above is a conjuction search of X among x and O.  The
bottom row is a feature search of X among x and o.  The left displays
have four distractors, the right displays have six distractors.

<p>If we were to plot mean response times of these four types of
displays, we'd get a graph something like this (for human data):
<br>
<pre>
     ^
     |    * conjunction search
     |   /
  RT |  /
     | *
     |
     | *--* feature search
     |
     +-+--+->
       4  6
      Number of Distractors 
</pre>
<br>We want to know whether the guided search model will 
generate predictions of that form.

<p> Derive predictions of the guided search model when applied to
these displays. Specifically, work out the number of item evaluations
that would be needed, assuming that f<sub>x</sub>=1, f<sub>o</sub>=2,
f<sub>uppercase</sub>=1, f<sub>lowercase</sub>=2,
d<sub>shape</sub>=d<sub>case</sub>=0.5, noise variance is zero, and
the stopping criterion is zero.  Plot the predicted number of
evaluations as in Fig.10.11a, i.e., like the graph above.

<p>If the noise variance is, instead of zero, a reasonably large
value, then which display would tend to be fastest and which would
tend to be slowest (that is, what is the difference in salience
between the target and the distractors for each display)?

<p>(There is a <a href="guidedsearch.html">worked example of
computations in the the guided search model</a> on the web.)
