<p><strong>Lewontin reading.</strong> Compose answers to questions
3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 (p. 131 of SnS).  One page maximum per answer, please!  (It
might be better to do the exercise below before answering the Lewontin
questions.)

<p><strong>Evolution of networks.</strong> Consider the XOR problem in
a 1-hidden layer backprop network (cf. pp. 117-126).  In previous
homework, you found that success in solving the task depended on the
number of hidden nodes.  In this exercise, we'll pretend that networks
that learn the XOR pass on their genes to the next generation, and the
<em>genes determine the number of hidden nodes</em> in the progeny.
That is, a parent network with H hidden nodes has children with H
hidden nodes.

<p>Let's suppose that if a network gets below an error of 0.1 by sweep
4000 (puberty), then the network generates <strong>2</strong>
children, with the same number of hidden nodes (but with random
initial weights).

<p>There is a cost of having hidden nodes, however, because it takes
more food to maintain a larger network.  So, while larger networks
will probably solve the learning task better than smaller networks,
they might not find enough food to live until puberty (4000 sweeps).
Here are the relevant probabilities:

<td align=right>2</td>
<td align=right>3</td>
<td align=right>4</td>
<td align=right>5</td>
<td align=right>6</td>

<tr>
<td align=center>probability of 
<br>reaching criterial error 
<br>by puberty</td>
<td align=right>0.00</td>
<td align=right>0.40</td>
<td align=right>0.80</td>
<td align=right>0.95</td>
<td align=right>0.98</td>
<td align=right>0.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>probability of 
<br>finding enough food 
<br>until puberty</td>
<td align=right>0.99<sup>(pop./600)</sup></td>
<td align=right>0.90<sup>(pop./600)</sup></td>
<td align=right>0.80<sup>(pop./600)</sup></td>
<td align=right>0.70<sup>(pop./600)</sup></td>
<td align=right>0.60<sup>(pop./600)</sup></td>
<td align=right>0.50<sup>(pop./600)</sup></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Notice that the probability of getting enough food depends on the
total size of the population, denoted by "pop." in the table.  The
higher the population, the lower the probability of finding enough
food.  For example, if the population is 1200, then the probability
that a network with 6 hidden nodes would find enough food is
0.50<sup>(1200/600)</sup>=0.25.

<p>If a network both learns the XOR and gets enough food, then it will
generate 2 children.  After this, all the elderly networks die, and
the children all try to learn the XOR and get enough food.

<p><strong>Fill in the table below, to find out which size network
will become the most prevalent after 5 generations in this
environment, when starting with a uniform distribution of hidden
layers sizes, in a population of 600 networks.</strong> You don't need
to simulate any networks for this exercise; just compute the expected
values of the number of survivors in each generation based on the
probabilities in the table above.  For each generation, use the total
population as the value for "pop." in the table above.
