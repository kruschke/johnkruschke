<p>This assignment refers to the book by McLeod, Plunkett and Rolls.


<ul>

<p><li>(Ch. 7.) Answer the questions in the last paragraph of p. 151.
Include a graph of the error, to justify your answer. <a
href="srn_in_Tlearn.htm">A linked page shows output of Tlearn for this
exercise.</a>.

<p><li>(Ch. 4.) Show printouts that verify the statements made on
p. 95, with annotation describing how each printout addresses and
verifies the statements. (There are essentially three statements on
p. 95, corresponding to the three paragraphs.)

<p><li>(Ch. 6.) Consider a competitive learning network with two input
nodes and two output nodes.  Suppose there are three input patterns to
learn: (.9,.6), (.9,.4), (.1,.5).  Suppose that the weight vectors of
the two output nodes start at (.6,.6) and (.4,.4).  Let the learning
rate be 0.5.  Compute the values of the weights for three epochs
through the three input patterns (in the fixed order listed before).
Plot the patterns and the trajectories of the weight vectors like the
graphs in Figure 6.4.

Compute
the activation of the cluster nodes in terms of Euclidean
distance, NOT as weighted summation. That is, do NOT
do it as in Equation 6.1 of the text book! 
<p>
For example, the exercise states that the two
cluster nodes start of with weights of (.6,.6) and
(.4,.4). The first input pattern is (.9,.6). Therefore the
distance between the first cluster node and the input
pattern is 
<center>
  [(.6-.9)^2 + (.6-.6)^2]^.5 = 0.30   
</center>
and the distance between the second cluster node
and the input pattern is 
<center>
  [(.4-.9)^2 + (.4-.6)^2]^.5 = 0.54   
</center>
The first cluster node is closer to the input
pattern, so it is the winner and it changes its weights.
The exercise states that the learning rate is 0.5,
so the changes in weights for the winning (first) cluster
node are 
<center>
  change in w1 = 0.5 * (.9-.6) = 0.15   
<br>change in w2 = 0.5 * (.6-.6) = 0.00   
</center>
Hence the new weights for the first cluster node
are 
<center>  
w1 = .6 + .15 = .75   
<br>
w2 = .6 + .00 = .60   
</center>
<p>Continue in this manner through all the training patterns, for
three epochs.
