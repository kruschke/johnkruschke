<p><strong>Exercises, p. 363 of SnS</strong> (60 pts. total)

<dl>

<p><dt>First... <dd>Make commutative diagrams of DFM and FLMP applied
to letter perception. For an example of this sort of commutative
diagram, see the end of the <a href="gravmodel.html"> reading on the
web regarding Newton's model of gravity</a>, and see the <a
href="TemplateSimModel.gif">diagram for the template similarity
model</a>.  Hint: The three boxes in Figure 8.17, p. 326, should all
be <em>inside</em> the "formal transformation" portion of your
diagram.

<p><dt>8.1.  <dd>Explain exactly what the parameter values
<em>mean</em>, for the DFM and for the FLMP.  Derive the predictions
numerically, and also plot them graphically.

<p><dt>8.2.  <dd>Derive the predictions numerically, and also plot
them graphically.  Do the same thing for parameter values of 0.01,
0.01 and 0.99 for one factor, and 0.01, 0.99 and 0.99 for the second
factor.

<p><dt>8.3.  <dd>Derive the predictions numerically, and also plot
them graphically.  Be sure to show carefully how you derived the
formulas for the additive FLMP.

<p><dt>Extra credit... <dd>Derive formulas for a "multiplicative DFM,"
and then determine predictions of the multiplicative DFM for the
parameter values provided in exercise 8.1.
