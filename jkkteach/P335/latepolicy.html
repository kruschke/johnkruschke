<h2>Late Policy</h2></center>

<p>All exams and homeworks are mandatory.

<p>If you know in advance that you will be missing an exam 
or homework due date, please notify Professor Kruschke as soon as
possible, and well before the due date, so that alternative
arrangements can be made.

<p>If you unexpectedly miss an exam  or homework due date, you
must notify Professor Kruschke <em>as soon as possible</em>,
preferably the same day, by phone or e-mail if not in person.  Only
<em>documented</em> emergencies will be excused.

<p>If an exam is missed, a make-up exam might have a different format
than the exam given in class, at the instructor's discretion.

<p><strong>Penalty</strong> for <em>unexcused</em> late homework 
is as follows:

One third of the points possible are deducted off the
top for homework handed in up to a week late.  After a week, a score
of <em>zero</em> is assigned.  Thus, for homework handed in less than
a week late, a maximum of 13 points (= 2/3 x 20) is possible.  For
homework handed in more than a week late, no points are awarded.
