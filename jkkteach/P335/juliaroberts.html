<p>Templates, Features and Structure in Face Recognition
</h2>
</center>

<font size=+1>

<p> How do we recognize a face despite changes in viewing
angle, image size, facial expression, hair style, etc.? As an example,
look at the pictures below.  Our ability to recognize a person despite
these changes is an example of "constancy."

<p>
<table align=center>
<tr>
<td align=center valign=center>
<img src="juliarobertsthreequarterview.jpg">
</td>
<td align=center valign=center rowspan=2>
<img src="juliarobertsprofile.jpg">
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center valign=center>
<img src="juliaroberts.jpg">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Can face recognition be explained by <strong>template</strong>
representation?  There would have to be a lot of stored templates to
handle all the different images we can recognize.

<p><hr>

<p>Can face recognition be explained by <strong>feature</strong>
representation? Consider the following rearrangement of features:

<p>
<table align=center cellspacing=30>
<tr><td>
<img src="juliaroberts.jpg">
<br clear=all>
</td><td>
<img src="juliarobertsrearrangedfeatures.jpg">
<br clear=all>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The face on the right has the same features as the face on the
left, but doesn't look like the same person. So face recognition is
more than just having the right features; they need to be in the right
places.

<p><hr>

<p>Can face recognition be explained by <strong>structural</strong>
representation, in which the features have to be not only present, but
in the right place? Consider the upside-down pictures below. They both
have the features in the right places.

<p>
<table align=center cellspacing=30>
<tr><td>
<img src="juliarobertsupsidedown.jpg">
<br clear=all>
</td><td>
<img src="juliarobertsupsidedownfeatures.jpg">
<br clear=all>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now turn your head upside down and look again. Ugh! So it's more
than getting the features in the right place, it's getting a whole
variety of featural relationships correct.
