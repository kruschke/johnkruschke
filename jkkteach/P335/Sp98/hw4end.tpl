<p>Table 1 (above) contains in each cell the four ratings you gave for
the corresponding pair of characteristics.  For example, for the pair
"level-headed" and "good-natured", you gave ratings of
[s111]. [s112]. [s113] and [s114].  What we want to do now is explore
a model of how you combined the two characteristics into a rating.

<p><strong>An Additive Model of Information Integration.</strong>
Figure 1 (below) shows a flowchart for information integration.  It
starts with the two characteristics, on the left.  This pair of
characteristics is the physical stimulus.  When the characteristics
are perceived, they are then mentally converted to psychological
values (as indicated by the arrows).  The flowchart shows that this
convertion is done independently for the two characteristics; for
example, the model asserts that the psychological value for
"level-headed" is the same regardless of whether the other
characteristic is "good-natured" or "humorless".  Once these two
psychological values have been established, they are then integrated
or combined into a single psychological value (labelled "Integrated
Psych. Value" in Figure 1).  The <em>additive</em> version of this
model asserts that the integrated psychological value is obtained by
<em>adding</em> the two individual psychological values.  Other
versions of the model hypothesize <em>multiplication</em> of values,
or <em>averaging</em>, or more complicated processes.  We will be
investigating the additive model.  After the integrated psychological
value is determined, it is converted into an overt rating, i.e., the
response.

<p>This theory makes certain claims about the representations and
processing involved in information integration.  In terms of
representation, it claims that the characteristics can be represented
as single values on a psychological scale.  The theory makes no claims
about what other representations, such as semantic features, might
generate these values.  Thus, the content of the representation is
just the scale values of the characteristics, and the format of the
representation is "metric", i.e., organization by order and distance
on a scale.  In terms of processing, the theory asserts that the scale
values are generated independently, and that the integrated
psychological value is obtained merely by adding the two
characteristic values.

<p>We want to find out whether this additive model fits your ratings.

<p><strong>Summarize your data.</strong> We need to get a better view
of your ratings.  For each combination of characteristics, compute
your mean rating and enter the means in the table below.  For example,
in the top-left cell, that is, for the combination "level-headed" and
"good-natured", you should write the mean of [s111], [s112], [s113],
and [s114] (these were your four ratings of this combination).

<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td colspan=4 align=center><em>Table 2: Mean Ratings</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center></td>
<td align=center><strong>good-natured</strong></td>
<td align=center><strong>bold</strong></td>
<td align=center><strong>humorless</strong></td>

<strong>ungrateful</strong>	 
</td>		 
<td align=center>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now make a graph of your mean ratings.  The two independent
variables (I.V.'s) in this experiment are the two sets of
characteristics.  The dependent variable (D.V.) is your (mean) rating.
So, plot the D.V. as a function of the I.V.'s on the axes below.  Plot
separate lines for "level-headed", "unsophisticated", and
"ungrateful" (and be sure to label them).

Graph 1: Your Mean Ratings
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>



<p><strong>Generate predictions of the model.</strong> Now that you
have a good picture of your data, you need to see how well the
additive model fits them.  So we need to determine the best estimate
of your psychological values for each of the characteristics.  Refer
back to Figure 1: We know the stimuli on the left of the figure, and
we know your ratings on the right of the figure; we need now to
determine the psychological values in the middle of the figure.  For
example, we want to determine the psychological value for, say,
"level-headed", which can be added to the psychological value of
"good-natured", such that the sum matches your mean rating for the
pair, "level-headed" and "good-natured".  But these estimated
psychological values also have to simultaneously satisfy the other
ratings you gave.

<p>To determine the best estimates of your psychological values, we
need to find (1) the mean ratings you gave to individual
characteristics, and (2) the overall mean rating you gave.  The table
below will help you do this.  

<p>First, copy into Table 3 (below) the cell means from Table 2
(above).  Be careful to copy accurately. Now compute the "marginal"
means (i.e., means on the margin of the table), as follows.  For cells
in the table with the phrase <em>row mean</em> (far right column),
compute the mean rating for that row.  For example, the row mean for
<strong>level-headed</strong> is the mean of the three cell-means for
level-headed; thus, for the cells labelled a, b, and c, the row mean
is (a+b+c)/3.



<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td colspan=5 align=center><em>Table 3: Marginal and Overall Means</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center></td>
<td align=center><strong>good-natured</strong></td>
<td align=center><strong>bold</strong></td>
<td align=center><strong>humorless</strong></td>
<td align=center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>
<strong>level-headed</strong>
</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(a)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(b)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(c)</td>
<td><em>row mean</em> (a+b+c)/3 = _____ </td>
</tr>		 
<tr>		 
<td align=center>
<strong>unsophisticated</strong>
</td>		 
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(d)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(e)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(f)</td>
<td><em>row mean</em> (d+e+f)/3 = _____ </td>
</tr>		 
<tr>		 
<td align=center>
<strong>ungrateful</strong>	 
</td>		 
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(g)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(h)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(i)</td>
<td><em>row mean</em> (g+h+i)/3 = _____ </td>
</tr>
<tr>		 
<td></td>		 
<td><em>column mean</em>  (a+d+g)/3   = _____ </td>
<td><em>column mean</em>  (b+e+h)/3   = _____ </td>
<td><em>column mean</em>  (c+f+i)/3   = _____ </td>
<td><em>Overall mean</em> (a+...+i)/9 = _____ </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now you convert the marginal means to <em>estimated psychological
values</em> by subtracting half of the overall mean from each marginal
mean.  For example, the psychological value for level-headed is its
row mean minus half of the overall mean.  Write these estimated
psychological values for each characteristic in Table 4 (below).
Finally, to get the predicted ratings of the additive model, just fill
in the cells of Table 4 by adding the values of the row and column
characteristics.

<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10>

<td colspan=4 align=center><em>Table 4: Predicted Ratings from Additive Model</em></td>

<td align=center>

<td align=center>&nbsp;</td>

</table>


<p>It's beyond the intended scope of this assignment to explain
thoroughly why the values derived above are the best estimates.  As
partial explanation, you probably recognize that this is a lot like
ANOVA or linear regression, and you remember that means are the best
estimates for main effects in ANOVA.  We are doing something very
similar, estimating the main effects as marginal means.

<p>Now plot the predicted ratings of the additive model in Graph 2
below, just as you plotted your mean ratings above (in Graph 1).

<p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>
<IMG SRC="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/hw4blankgraph.gif" align=center>
</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>
Graph 2: Additive Model Predicted Ratings
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The lines of the predicted ratings should be parallel, but not
necessarily straight.  That is, the spacing between lines should be
constant, so that, for example, the difference between level-headed
and unsophisticated is the same across all three of the
characteristics good-natured, bold and humorless.  This parallelness
is a hallmark of additive models.  An additive model predicts no
interaction between variables (in terms of ANOVA).

<p>Are the lines in your graph of your mean ratings (Graph 1)
approximately parallel?

<center>Circle one: <em>Yes / No</em></center>

<p>Do the predicted ratings match your actual mean ratings fairly
well?  That is, does Graph 2 approximately match Graph 1? 

<center>Circle one: <em>Yes / No</em></center>

(We could test, statistically, whether the predicted ratings
significantly deviate from your actual ratings.  This would be simply
a test of interaction in ANOVA.  But you don't need to do this for the
present exercise.)

<p>Do you believe, intuitively, that you were mentally adding
psychological values to come up with your ratings?

<center>Circle one: <em>Yes / No</em></center>


<p><strong>Laboratory results.</strong> In a laboratory version of
this experiment (see "To learn more," below), the mean ratings were
very well fit by the additive model.  Other kinds of information
integration are better fit by other integration functions.  For
example, consider playing poker against two other players.  Suppose
you are told the strength of the other players' hands - weak, medium,
or strong - and you must rate how tough it is to win against them.  In
this situation, peoples' ratings are best fit by a multiplicative
model.


<p><strong>So what?</strong> How people integrate information to make
decisions is a crucial issue in a wide range of situations.
Manufacturers want to know how consumers integrate information about
various products to decide what brand to buy.  Retailers want to know
how people combine information about stores to decide where to shop.
Managers want to know how employees combine information to make
critical decisions on the job.  Lawyers want to know how jurists
combine information to decide guilt or innocence.  You can think of
many other situations where an understanding of information
integration in decision making could have huge consequences.

<p><strong>To learn more:</strong> This exercise is based on an
article by N. H. Anderson (1962), "Application of an additive model to
impression formation", <em>Science</em>, v.138, pp.817-818.
N. H. Anderson has many more recent papers and books on this general
topic.
