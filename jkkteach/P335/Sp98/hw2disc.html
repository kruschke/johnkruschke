<p>Yes, you're right, at least for self-terminating search with the
probe present.  In self-terminating search, once the probe is found,
then there is no checking of further items, so the <em>last time
through, when the probe is present,</em> there is <em>no</em> addition
of 10 msec for "Another Item?".

<p>When the probe is absent, self-terminating search continues through
all the items, and checks for another item after every item checked.
So for absent probes, the 10 msec for "Another Item?" <em>does</em>
get added for every item.

<p>In exhaustive scan, the loop continues through all the items, even
after the probe is found in the memory set, and so the time for
checking "Another Item?" <em>is</em> included every time.

<p>When writing the homework assignment, I simply hadn't thought of
this subtlety for self-terminating search with probe present, and so
the homework is unintentionally misleading.  For grading purposes,
we'll accept either answer.

<p>Curiously, this same problem was present on Homework 1, which also
involved self-terminating serial search (in vision), but nobody
noticed (or at least nobody who noticed told me about it).  This time,
you and several other people noticed.  To me this is a good sign:
You're really learning and understanding the details!  I think the <a
href="stmselanim.html">animated flowcharts</a> also helped people
understand the details.  Did they?
