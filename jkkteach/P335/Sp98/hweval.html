<h2>
P335 Cognitive Psychology, Prof. Kruschke
<br>Homework Assignment Evaluation Form
<p>What do <em>you</em> think about this assignment?
</h2>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, one of
the goals of this course is for you to better understand theories and
their relation to data in cognitive psychology.  The homework
assignments are designed to help you achieve this goal.

<p>Please tell Professor Kruschke whether this assignment achieved
this goal, by filling out the form below.  Although your evaluation is
not anonymous, the content of your reply has no impact on your grade
whatsoever.  Your sincere evaluation will help improve future
assignments, and you get 2 points for your effort (just once per
assignment, of course).

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You may only submit an evaluation of
a homework assignment after the corresponding class lecture but before
the next one is due.  For example, an evaluation of the 2nd homework
assignment must be submitted after the lecture of the day it was due,
but before the 3rd homework is due.  You may not submit (for credit)
an evaluation of an assignment before it is due, nor after the next
one is due.  But you are always welcome to <a
href=mailto:kruschke@indiana.edu>e-mail Professor Kruschke</a>
anytime.
