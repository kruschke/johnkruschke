<p><dt>May 6: <dd><strong>Last day for evaluations</strong> of
homework and papers was announced in class to be the day of the final
exam.  But, as this was only announced in class once, and not posted
here, the deadline is extended until Thursday May 7.  Any evaluations
submitted after that cannot be included in your final grade.

<p><dt>Apr 30: <dd><strong>Grade adjustments?</strong> Some students have
asked whether adjustments in their grades could be made, to reflect
improvement or some other aspect of their situation.  Here is my
thinking on this topic:

<ol>

<p><li>I start with this premise: A student's letter grade should
reflect his or her <em>overall performance</em> in the class.

<p>This is why there is a relatively large number (4) of exams and
papers due throughout the semester.  This larger sample size gives a
better estimate of a student's overall performance.

<p><li>Should "overall performance" also include a measure of
<em>improvement</em>?

<p>I think not, for three reasons.  First, rewarding improvement
unfairly penalizes people who start off scoring high.  There's no
place for them to improve to.  Second, if improvement is rewarded,
shouldn't worsening be penalized?  Third, the tactical student might
purposely score moderately low on the initial assignments, to generate
artificial improvement later, depending on the exact scheme by which
improvement is factored into the reward structure.



<p><li>Should "overall performance" discount <em>unrepresentative
scores</em>?

<p>This is the classical problem of dealing with "outliers" in
statistics.  There's one central complication with discounting
outliers: Both scores that are unusually low <em>and scores that are
unusually high</em> should be discounted.  That is, a score that is
very high might be unrepresentative: It was lucky, or an unusually
good cram session the night before, or whatever.  I don't think anyone
wants their high scores discounted.

<p><li>So, I'm going to stick with the grading method stated in the
syllabus.  I'll rely on the "large N" approach to getting a realistic
measure of overall performance.

<p>If you have other extenuating circumstances, however, you should
let me know.

</ol>

<p> <dt>Feb 11: <dd>Due date for <strong>Homework 1
Evaluations</strong> has been extended to Thursday, Feb. 19, 11:15 am.
Please note that evaluations are <em>not</em> extra credit.  The
points involved in evaluations are part of the baseline for computing
percentage points.  Thus, without doing the evaluations, the best
percentage you can achieve is 96%.

<p> <dt>Feb 11: <dd><strong>Current scores</strong> can be found via
the web at URL <a

trouble viewing your scores, contact Kam.

<p> <dt>Feb 11: <dd><strong>Homework 2 (STM scanning)</strong> now
has a <a href="hw2disc.html">question and answer page</a>.

<p> <dt>Feb 04: <dd><strong>Homework 2</strong> has been slightly
updated.  An introductory paragraph has been added, which gives a
real-life illustration of STM scanning.  A few sentences here and
there were clarified, as well.

flowchart.

<p> <dt>Feb 02: <dd><strong><a href="exam1.html">Exam 1 Review
Topics</a></strong> are now updated and posted.

<p> <dt>Jan 29: <dd><strong>Late penalties</strong> are now
formalized.  See the <a href="latepolicy.html">late policy</a> for
details.

<p> <dt>Jan 26: <dd><strong>Summer program in cognitive
neuroscience:</strong> The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, a
joint program of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon
University, offers an annual summer program for a small number of
qualified undergraduates interested in studying cognitive or
computational neuroscience. The application deadline this year is
February 15, 1998. The program begins in early June and lasts for 10
weeks.  For additional information about the program or to obtain
application materials, visit our web site at <a
href="http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/Training/summer">
http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/Training/summer/</a>.


<p> <dt>Jan 23: <dd><strong>Homework 1 (visual search)</strong> now
has a <a href="hw1disc.html">question and answer page</a>.

<p> <dt>Jan 23: <dd><strong>Kam Silva's office</strong> has
changed. It is now Psych 293D, instead of 293C.


<p> 
<dt>Jan 08: 
<dd>Our <strong>assistant instructor</strong> is Kam Silva.  Her office
is Psych 293C, phone 855-1554.  Office hours are M, W 2:30-3:30 and by appt.
E-mail: kasilva@indiana.edu.

<p> 
<dt>Jan 08: 
<dd>Each <strong>relevance paper</strong>'s topic must correspond with
concurrent course topic.  For example, the first relevance paper must
draw implications from topics studied in weeks 1-4, such as perception
and attention, etc.  The second paper must draw implications from
topics studied during weeks 5-8, such as memory and imagery.  And so
on for the third and fourth papers.  Implications from non-concurrent
course topics will not be given credit!  If, for example, you write
about implications from attentional research for your third relevance
paper, you won't get credit.  The main <em>purpose</em> of this
requirement is to make sure you consider real-life implications from
material <em>throughout</em> the course.  (This requirement
contradicts a statement made in the initial version of this
assignment, which advised you to draw implications from all topics in
the course.  Unfortunately, this advice was vestigial from last time
this course was taught, when there was a single large term paper
instead of four small papers.)

<p> 
<dt>Jan 08: 
<dd><strong>Need Help?</strong>  The <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~sac/">I.U. Student Academic Center</a>
is offering a semester-long, one-credit, pass/fail course that can
help you do well in this class--and all your IU classes.  The course,
Education X152 "College and Life Long Learning" (Section 5357),
teaches a wide range of useful skills, including how to manage your
time, how to take effective notes, how to do well on essay tests, and
how to succeed during finals week. The course is a series of workshops
that meet every Wednesday night from 7 to 8 p.m., and individual
sessions with graduate AIs and successful undergraduates are scheduled
twice a month to help you get the most out of the material.  To find
out more about this course, call the Student Academic Center at
855-7313 or attend the first workshop at 7 p.m. on Jan. 14 at Woodburn
Hall 101.  Or simply add the course by following the instructions on
page 22 of the Spring Schedule of Classes.
