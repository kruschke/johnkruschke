<h2><a href="exam1.html">Exam 1</a> Review Topics</h2>

<p>Essay Question Topics:

<ul>

<li>Kruschke's definition of cognitive psychology.  What is in any
theory of a cognitive phenomenon? (lecture)

<li>Laboratory procedures for evaluating feature theories of pattern
recognition; specifically Gibson's experiment and theory, pp.24-28.

<li>The word-superiority effect and the interactive-activation model;
pp.39-43 and lecture.

<li>What makes a person a good fighter pilot or bus driver?  What
laboratory procedure measured this? (pp. 71-73 and lecture)


</ul>

<p>Multiple choice question topics:

<ul>

<li>Know the knowledge organization diagram in the <a
href="syllabus.html#goals">syllabus</a>. (lecture)

<li>Evidence for templates in human pattern recognition, specifically
Phillips experiment, pp. 21-24 and lecture.

<li>How do most computers or robots recognize patterns? (lecture)

<li>Feature theories of pattern recognition.  What laboratory
procedures are used to evaluate them? (pp. 24-29)

<li>Hierarchical cluster diagrams (in relation to feature theories of
pattern recognition; p.27 of Reed).

<li>Template theories of perceived similarity; be able to recognize
graphs consistent or inconsistent with template theory predictions
(Homework 1).

<li>Bottom-up vs. top-down context effects, and examples of each. (lecture)

<li>Interactive-activation model of context effects: How it explains
the word-superiority effect and face priming. (pp.39-46 and lecture)

<li>Sperlings's and Rumelhart's models of performance in the
whole-report procedure (pp.35-38 of Reed).

<li>Pre-attentive and attentive levels of perception. (pp. 51-58 and
lectures regarding feature-integration theory)

<li>(Unlimited capacity) parallel and (self-terminating) serial search
processes in visual search tasks; be able to recognize graphs of
predicted RTs for each of these processes. (lecture regarding visual
search experiments)

<li>Role of attention in vision <em>and</em> audition (what is attention for,
what does it do, in seeing <em>and</em> hearing). (lecture)

<li>Illusory conjunctions. (lecture)

<li>Broadbent's filter theory of attention and evidence that it is
incomplete. (pp. 51-58 and lecture)

<li>Understand bottleneck and capacity theories of
attention. (especially summary, pp. 61-62)

<li>Attention to events: How did Neisser and Becklen demonstrate this?
(lecture)

<li>The Stroop effect and its explanation in terms of automatic
processes (pp. 64-65 and lecture)

</ul>
