</pre>

<p>The <em>result</em> is simply that the second run avoids the false
paths of the first run.  (There was no I.V. or D.V. explicitly
mentioned in lecture, and stating the I.V. and D.V. will not be
required on the exam, but you can think of the I.V. as the <em>run
number</em> [first run, second run] and the D.V. as the <em>number of
moves until the goal is found</em>.)

<p>The theories need to explain this difference in behavior.  See <a
href="#maze">below</a>, and also the <a href="mazemodels.html">web
notes</a> on this topic.

</pre>

<p>What exactly is the result that needs to be explained?  What
exactly is the form of the curve that relates response time to degree
of rotation?  What is it about this result that makes "mental
rotation" the natural explanation?  Can you answer this question
before reading on?

<p>Answer: Response time is a <em>linear</em> function of angle of
rotation.

<p>Now, how does the theory of "mental rotation" explain that result?
What is the critical constraint on mental rotation, posited by the
theory?

<p>Answer: Mental rotation occurs at a fixed speed, for a given type
of figure being rotated.  Were it not for this fixed-speed constraint,
there would not necessarily be a linear increase in RT's.  (Or course,
other theories might also be able to fit the linear increase, but
what's critical in this theory is the fixed speed of rotation.)

<a name="alignheur"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> Professor Kruschke-- My notes about alignment and rotation
> heuristics in cognitive maps are inadequate.  Would you please briefly
> outline these ideas?  Thanks so much!
</pre>

<p>When doing mental geography, people make systematic mistakes.  For
example, when asked what's farther west, Reno or Los Angeles, people
will tend to say L.A., even though Reno is actually farther west.

<p>These kinds of mistakes seem to be caused by systematic distortions
in people's mental maps, or in the way people use their mental maps.
There are two kinds of distortions we discussed, namely, the rotation
heuristic and the alignment heuristic.

<p>The rotation heuristic applies to single objects, such as a single
state, or single nation, or single island, etc.  People tend to rotate
the object so it is better aligned with vertical or horizontal.  For
example, people's mental map of California is more aligned with
vertical (north-south) than is really should be, because in reality,
California is quite "tilted" geographically.

<p>The alignment heuristic applies to two or more objects, such as two
or more continents.  People tend to align these objects on a common
vertical or horizontal axis more than they should be.  So, for
example, when comparing the USA and Europe, people tend to mentally
align the contintents to about the same latitude, but in reality
Europe is much farther north than the USA.

<p>
<img src="illusion2.gif">

<p>The experiment by Wallace demonstrated that when people of high
imagery ability imagined the <em>inducing</em> lines (at left in the
figure above) while actually looking at the <em>target</em> lines
(middle above), they suffered a visual illusion wherein the target
lines looked bowed apart, despite really being parallel.  (The figure
above doens't give the best effect because of limited resolution.)

<p>The point is that this is another piece of evidence that imagery
and perception use some of the same mental machinery, and can
interfere/interact with each other when done at the same time.

</pre>

<p>Yes, you should know about these strategies.  All these strategies
apply to learning about a conjunctive rule.  That is, they are
strategies for identifying relevant attributes for a rule known in
advance to be conjunctive.

<p>Conservative focussing is just probing 'til a positive instance is
found, then changing one attribute at a time, to test for
single-attribute relevance.

<p>Focus gambling also starts with finding a positive instance, but
then changing more than one attribute at a time.  This is a gamble
because your next case might still be in the concept, and therefore
you know that all the changed attributes are irrelevant (big payoff
for small investment), but your next case might be outside the
concept, and then you don't know which of the changed attributes is
relevant (little payoff).

<p>Global focusing is a strategy whereby more than one hypothesis is
tested at a time.  We didn't talk about it much in lecture, and you
need not worry over it for the exam.

<p>Yes, you should know about the Brooks experiment, in both its
visual and verbal (auditory) forms.

<p>The visual illusion experiment is summarized above.

</pre>

<p>A schema is just a framework for organizing information in
memory (see more details in the textbook).  The theory says that we use
schemas when encoding and retrieving information from memory.  The
theory can explain phenomena such as the difficulty of encoding
information when we don't have a schema for it (e.g., the description
of the urban serenade; or, trying to learn cognitive psychology for
the first time).  The theory can also explain phenomena such as false
recall of details that are consistent with the schema, but didn't
actually occur (after all, memory is reconstructive [an old theme!]).

</pre>

<p>Keeping your knowledge <em>organized</em> is crucial for
understanding and for remembering.  The time you spend figuring
out how it all fits together will pay off in terms of
performance on exams and in terms of your enjoyment of the
class!

<p>To help digest the readings, it's crucial always to keep in
mind the "big picture" --- <em>why</em> is the author
discussing this particular thing in this particular place?
What point is it supposed to be illustrating or demonstrating?
Be sure you can answer this question; if you can't, then you
don't really understand!

<p>The knowledge organization diagram from the syllabus is
intended to help you keep the big picture.  Whenever you read
about an experiment in the book, or hear about one in lecture,
you should be able to fill in all the leaves of the knowledge
organization tree.  Sometimes an experment is discussed in
terms of its results only, without a theory thoroughly
described.  In these cases, you should at least be aware that
if a theory were proposed, it would have to specify
representation and process.

</pre>

<p>The experimental fact to be explained is that people (and rats)
take a more direct route on the second run than the first.  This is
all that is being emphasized in this particular demo. See also related
question <a href="#maze2">above</a>.

<p>Then comes the issue of how to explain this result.  What is going
on in people's minds that underlies this learning?  In the explanation
that posits analogue representation, the first run builds up a
cognitive map (this is a <em>process</em> of learning), and the second
run scans the map (again a <em>process</em>) before actually moving.
The representations and processes are listed in a <a
href="mazemodels.html">web-linked table</a>.

<p>Check out Box 7.1 (pp.202-203) of the textbook, entitled "Mental
images help athletes train their bodies".  You should read about what
sorts of mental imagery are beneficial, and what sorts are
detrimental.

</pre>

<p>I am referring to strategies such as "conservative focussing",
discussed in class.  This particular stategy is effective when you
know that the rule is a conjunctive rule, and all you have to do is
discover the relevant attributes (referred to as "attribute learning"
on p.224 of the textbook).

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->


<a name="science"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> How exactly is conservatice focussing NOT like a science.
> My notes weren't really clear on this topic.  
</pre>

<p>In scientific method, the goal is to discover what factors are
causally related to an outcome (and in what manner they are related to
an outcome).  We don't know in advance what factors will have an
effect, and we don't know in advance how the factors combine to
produce the effect.  We don't know in advance what kind of "rule"
produces the outcome, and in particular, we don't know that a
conjunctive rule will work; the factors might instead interact in
complex ways.  Therefore conservative focussing will not suffice as a
strategy to figure out which factors are relevant to an effect.
Instead, we must exhaustively explore various combinations of levels
of factors, to map out any possible complex interactions.

<a name="featlap"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> Hi I have a couple of questions.

> ...
> Thanks
</pre>

<p>This is really just another perspective on the feature-listing
experiment of Rosch.  The idea is that members of a super-ordinate
category (e.g. chair, table, sofa as members of furniture) have
relatively few overlapping features, but members of a basic level
category (e.g., desk chair, dining room chair, living room chair as
members of chair) have relatively numerous overlapping features.
Members of subordinate categories also have many overlapping features.

> Hi I have a couple of questions.
> ...
> What is the shape identification experiment?
> Thanks
</pre>

<p>Either one will do for the exam.  The point I wish to emphasize
with these experiments is <em>evidence for a basic level in
categorization</em>.  

<p>Thus, for the category-verification experiment (see a picture and
verify that it is an instance of furniture, or of a chair, or of a
living-room chair), RT's were fastest at the basic level.

<p>For the outline-identification experiment (see an outline and try
to say what it is a picture of), identification of average shapes was
better for the basic level than the super-ordinate: The average chair
(basic level) is identifiable as a chair; the average piece of
furniture (super-ordinate level) is not identifiable as furniture.

<pre>

</pre>

<p>Semantic associate priming is described on p.272.  This involves
"lexical verification" (as opposed to sentence verification).  Each
trial has two successive words (or non-words), and verifying the
second can be facilitated if it is meaningfully related to the first.

<p>Path priming is described on p.266: "Collins and Quillian proposed
that the degree of facilitation should depend on whether one follows
the same path in the network to answer the two questions."  In
verifying two successive sentences, the second verification should be
facilitated if it uses some of the same path as the first
verification.

<p>Aside from the difference between tasks (sentence verification
vs. lexical verification), there are differences in the types of links
assumed by the models.  The hierarchical model only assumes "is-a"
links and "property" links.  The spreading activation models assumes
various types of weighted connections between any related concepts
(such as bread and butter).

> Thank you so much for clearing up these concepts
</pre>

<p>I think the key summary sentence is on p.278, 4th paragraph: "The
revision [in ACT] is simply that activation can stop at a subnode
rather than spread to the integrated facts linked to that subnode."
So factual inferences can be fast in ACT because responses can be
generated as soon as subnodes are activated, rather than waiting for
activation to spread to all the constituent facts.
