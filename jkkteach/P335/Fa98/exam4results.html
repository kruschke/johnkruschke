<p><h2>Exam 4 Results
</h2>

<p>Exam 4 turned out to be considerably more difficult than the
previous exams, probably because it relied more on book reading than
on lecture material.  We therefore adjusted everyone's score so that
the distribution of scores would be more similar to the first three
exams.  The adjustment was done as follows: We took your raw point
score from exam 4, multiplied by 1.1, and added 1.  This reflects
influence of two theories of psychological difficulty; i.e., both
multiplicative and additive effects of difficulty.  <em>The scores you
see in Post'Em are the final, adjusted scores.</em> The class
statistics below are also based on the final, adjusted scores.
