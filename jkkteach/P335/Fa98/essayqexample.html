<h2>Exam Essay Question Example</h2>

<strong>Q.</strong> Describe Sperling's partial-report procedure, the
results, and his explanation of those results.  (a) Describe the
stimuli, the procedure and task, and the key independent variable
(I.V.).  (b) Describe the dependent variable and the effect of the
I.V.  (c) Describe the representation and (d) process assumed by
Sperling's theoretical explanation of the results.<p>

<strong>A.</strong> <strong>Procedure:</strong> An array of letters
was flashed briefly, followed by a tone cue that indicated which row
of letters the participant was to report.  The key independent
variable was the delay duration (ISI) between the letters'
disappearance and the cue's occurrence.<br>

<strong>Results:</strong> Sperling measured the number of letters the
participant reported, and inferred the number of letters ``available''
by multiplying the number reported by the total number of rows in the
array.  Results were that the number of letters available was almost
the whole array (9-10 of 12 letters) when the cue delay (ISI) was
zero, but the number available declined to about 4.5 letters (the span
of apprehension) after about a half-second delay.<br>

<strong>Representation:</strong> Iconic memory is a rapidly decaying
snapshot, or template, of the image.  The <em>content</em> of the icon
is point-by-point brightness or color, and the <em>format</em> of the
icon is spatial.<br>

<strong>Process:</strong> An attentional spotlight moves from one item
(letter) to the next, to allow recognition of each letter pattern.
The movement of the spotlight takes time, during which the icon is
fading.<p>

<em>Note that the answer explicitly addresses every part of the
question, with section headers indicating each part.  Your answers
should be organized explicitly, too.</em><p>
