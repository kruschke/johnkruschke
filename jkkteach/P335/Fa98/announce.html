<p><dt>Oct.: <dd>Announcements have been moved to the <a

page</a>.

<p><dt>Sep. 21: <dd><strong><a href="exam1.html">Exam 1</a> Review
Session</strong> will be Wednesday September 23, 5:30-7:00 in PY 226
(the usual lecture room).


<p><dt>Sep. 10: <dd>Regarding <strong>Homework 1</strong>: First, a
number of people submitted evaluations of the homework before it was
due, which is too early according to the instructions.  Because this
is the first homework evaluation and people are still getting used to
the format and schedule, these early evaluations will be accepted for
credit.  For future homework assignments, however, evaluations must be
submitted at the appropriate time. Second, when the homework was
discussed in class on Sept 08, there was an error in the hand-written
values for the number of matching squares for different letters.
Specifically, the overhead showed that B and S have an overlap of 14,
which is incorrect.

<p><dt>Sep. 03: <dd>A <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/p335_bbs/p335.cgi">discussion
group</a> has been added to our web pages!  Please post questions,
answers, comments for our class.

<p><dt>Aug. 28: <dd>The paper copies of the <strong> <a
href="latepolicy.html">Late Policy</a> </strong> contain an error
regarding the maximum number of points possible for late homework or
papers.  The paper copy <em>correctly</em> states that one third of
the points are deducted off the top for homework or papers handed in
up to a week late without an excuse, but the paper copy
<em>in</em>correctly states the maximum point values.  The correct
points are as follows: For homework handed in less than a week late, a
maximum of 12 points (= 2/3 x 18) is possible.  For homework handed in
more than a week late, no points are awarded.  For papers handed in
less than a week late, a maximum of 18 points (= 2/3 x 27) is
possible.  For papers handed in more than a week late, no points are
awarded.
