<p><IMG SRC="compmet.gif" align=left> <strong>Course Topic:</strong>
Cognitive psychologists study how people perceive and attend to the
environment, how people learn and remember, how they comprehend and
produce language, and how they reason and make decisions.  
Prof. Kruschke defines cognitive psychology as the <em>reverse
engineering</em> of <em>mind</em>.  Reverse engineering is a procedure
that analyzes a working machine into its parts and interactions, with
the goals of explaining, manipulating, and replicating the behavior of
the machine.  For example, aerospace engineers in various countries
have been working hard to reverse engineer the American ``Stealth''
bomber.  In cognitive psychology, the object of inquiry is the mind, a
far more elusive target than the Stealth Bomber.  Cognitive psychology
treats the mind as the software, or program, that runs on the computer
hardware of the brain.  As illustrated in the figure at left, this
<em>computer metaphor</em> asserts that mind (the ``thought bubble'')
is to brain (the head) as software (the flowchart) is to hardware (the
circuit board).  Thus, one goal of cognitive psychology is to figure
out the flow of information processing in the complicated program
implemented by the brain.  The point of the computer metaphor is not
to assert that the mind <em>is</em> a program or that the brain
<em>is</em> a digital computer, rather, the point is that we might
study human cognition at the level of information processing
(software) separately from the level of neural processing (hardware),
just as we can with computers.  

<p>One theme common to all cognitive processes is <em>inference in the
face of uncertainty</em>.  When we perceive an object, we are making
an inference about the world, on the basis of uncertain stimulation on
our sensory receptors.  When we remember an event, we are making an
inference about what probably happened, on the basis of imperfect and
incomplete storage of information in our memories.  When we interpret
the meaning of a statement, we are making an inference about what the
speaker probably intends, on the basis of ambiguous words and
gestures.  When we decide whether or not to take an action, we are
making an inference about probable outcomes, on the basis of uncertain
and incomplete information about the situation.  This theme will
be a central topic in the course.

<p><a name="goals"></a> <IMG SRC="knoworgsmall.gif" align=left>
<strong>Goals of This Course:</strong> The figure at left shows how
knowledge in this course is organized.  The main goal of the course is
to help you understand this organized knowledge.  The course includes
many topics or themes (indicated at the top of the figure), such as
attention, perception, memory, etc., and within each topic are many
phenomena, such as the limited capacity of attention, or the
distinction between long-term and short-term memory.  (In the lowest
branches of the figure, ``IV'' and ``DV'' stand for independent
variable and dependent variable, respectively.) <em>One goal</em> of
the course is for you to discover real-life examples of these
phenomena, so that the <em>relevance</em> of the material to our lives
is clear.  <em>Another goal</em> of the course is for you to
understand scientific reasoning: both what happens in
<em>experiments</em> and how the results are explained with
<em>theories</em>. The overall goal is for you to understand better
the relations between laboratory data, theory, and everyday life, in
science generally, not only in cognitive psychology.

<p>The assignments and exams are designed to address these goals.  By
writing <em>application papers</em>, you will discover the relevance
of cognitive psychology to life outside the laboratory.  In these
papers and in <em>homework assignments</em> and <em>exams</em>, you
will better understand experiments and theories in cognitive
psychology.

<p> <a name="applications"></a> <IMG SRC="knoworgtop.gif"
align=right><strong>Application Papers:</strong> To discover the
relevance of cognitive psychology outside the laboratory (the top part
of the knowledge organization diagram, reproduced at the right), you
will compose four brief papers describing applications of cognitive
psychology to real life situations.  A thorough description of this
assignment is provided on <a href="relevance.html">separate pages</a>.
These application papers are also referred to as "relevance" papers.
Due dates are indicated on the <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a>.  Please read the <a href="latepolicy.html">policy
regarding papers turned in late</a>.

<p><IMG SRC="knoworgbot.gif" align=left><strong>Homework
Assignments:</strong> To better understand particular laboratory
experiments and their explanations (the bottom part of the knowledge
organization diagram, reproduced at the left), you will complete four
homework assignments.  Each assignment explores a particular set of
theories, which you manipulate to discover their different
predictions, to test how well their predictions match human data, and
to understand their underlying psychological principles (i.e., their
representation and process). The assignments are posted on the web,
and are available through links on the <a
href="schedule.html">detailed schedule</a>.  Please read the <a
href="latepolicy.html">policy regarding assignments turned in
late</a>.

<p><a name="exams"></a> <strong>Exams:</strong> Exams will consist of
a few short-essay questions combined with some multiple-choice
questions. The exam questions tend to emphasize the lower branches of
the knowledge organization, and questions will be explicitly
structured like the knowledge organization diagram. The exams help you
accomplish the goals of organizing your knowledge in a way that
applies to science (and life) generally.

<p>There will be three mid-term exams and a final exam (4 exams
total), on dates indicated in the <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a>. All four exams are mandatory.  Please read the <a
href="latepolicy.html">policy regarding missed exams</a>.

<p><strong>Course Web Pages:</strong> This class has extensive
information posted on the world wide web. Homework and paper
assignments, announcements, exam review questions, scores, etc., are
or will be posted there, along with this syllabus and schedule.

<p>You can access our class information at 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="index.html">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/</a></strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(All the letters in this web address are lower case except the "P"
in "P335", which is upper case.  The little squiggle, "~", is called a
tilde, and must be typed in as part of the address.  The tilde key is
usually located near the top left of the keyboard.)  Perhaps the most
important page is the <a href="schedule.html">detailed schedule</a>,
which has links to assignments, exam information, occasional lecture
notes, etc.

<p>All the public computer clusters on campus have easy access to the
web.  If you do not yet know how to browse the world-wide web, it is
important that you learn immediately.  There are brochures available
in the public computing clusters, and University Information
Technology Services (UITS) also has <a
href="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/abfy.html">STEPS classes</a> on many topics.
Detailed information about getting your first computing account at IU
is available at the following web page address: <a href="

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Course grades will be based
on absolute thresholds for total points (summing exams, papers and
homework assignments), according to the scale listed at the right.
(Notice that the cutoffs are <em>not</em> the traditional 50, 60, 70,
80, 90.) It is Psychology Department policy to give incompletes ("I"
grades) only with a valid medical excuse.

<p>After each homework assignment you should complete a web-based
evaluation, which is worth 2 points. These points are part of the base
for computing your percentage; that is, they are <em>not</em> merely
extra credit.

<p>If you want to dispute a score you receive, you must submit your
reasons <em>in writing</em>, along with your scored exam, paper, or
homework assignment. This policy is helpful for two reasons: First, if
a score change is justified, it gives us a paper document as a record
of the change. Second, it gives you a chance to think through and
present your argument carefully, to maximize your chances of success.
Submit your brief written argument first to the teaching assistant.
If the matter cannot be resolved to your satisfaction, then please see
Professor Kruschke.

<p><strong>Hints for Learning:</strong>
<UL>

<LI><em>Save this syllabus.</em>

<LI><em>Organize your knowledge.</em>

<br><em>(a)</em> One of the best ways to understand and remember the
information in this course is to organize your knowledge with the
organizational structure shown in the "goals" section, above. For
everything we discuss, you should be able to fill in all the
components of this structure. This will be emphasized and explained
throughout the course.

<br><em>(b)</em> The order of topics is not random. If you understand
the material, you should be able to explain why one topic came before
the other. One motivation for the ordering of topics is following
along the flow of information processing from the sensory periphery
(e.g., vision) to central cognition (e.g., problem solving). This
ordering is the level of organization <em>above</em> the structure in
the "goals" diagram; this is the level that organizes one topic
relative to another.

<LI><em>Ask questions.</em> Ask in class, ask the assistant and
Professor Kruschke at appointments or office hours, ask via e-mail,
ask in review sessions, ask in the library, ask at UITS. And keep
asking until you understand the answers.

<LI><em>Use our class Web page.</em> Topics for review, and exam
results, will be posted there.

<li><em>Explore</em> other learning resources, such as the <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~sac/">I.U. Student Academic Center</a>
(316 N. Jordan Ave., 855-7313).  See also the <a href="links.html">web
links</a> on the class web pages.

</UL>

<p> <strong>Required Textbook:</strong> Reed, S. K. (1996).
<em>Cognition</em>, <strong>4th Ed.</strong>. Pacific Grove,
CA: Brooks\Cole Publishing Co.  

<p> <strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes nor copies
of overhead projector transparencies are available. If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and after looking over those
notes if you have questions please see Prof. Kruschke or the assistant.

<p> <strong>Why Take this Course:</strong> P335 can partially fulfill
the Area A Requirement for the Psychology Major (B.A. or B.S.), and it
also fulfills the Mathematical Sciences and Cognition sub-area of the
Distribution Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree in the College of
Arts and Science. It can also fulfill requirements in other majors,
such as Cognitive Science. 

<p>You will probably discover, however, that the value of the course
extends far beyond the curricular requirements it fulfills.  As a
result of learning about human cognition, you can be a better decision
maker, be a better evaluator of information in the media, and be a
more tolerant and better understood person. By learning about
experiments and various theories, you can learn about the process of
scientific thinking, not just its ultimate products.  Finally, by
understanding the theories, you learn about a contemporary approach to
one of the most exciting areas of inquiry for the twenty-first
century, the workings of the mind. Two indications of the topic's
importance are that the College now includes "Cognition" in the title
of one of its required sub-areas, and there is a new major called
"Cognitive Science."

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be suggestive,
not absolute. Any and all of the information on this syllabus is
subject to change at any time, including exam dates, grading policies,
office hours, etc. Changes will be announced in class and on the Web.
