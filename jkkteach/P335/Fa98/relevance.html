<h2>Relevance Papers</h2></center>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, one of
the goals of this course is for you to discover the relevance of
cognitive psychology to everyday life.  The "relevance paper"
assignments are designed to help you achieve this goal.  (These papers
are also referred to as "application" papers.)

<p><hr>
<h2>The required <em>structure</em> of the papers.</h2>

<p>Your paper should first describe the cognitive aspects of some life
situation.  The situation could be something you have personally
experienced, but could also be taken from a movie, or from
observations of animals, or even from observations of computers.  The
crucial qualities are that the situation should (1) be from life
outside the research laboratory, and (2) involve some sort of putative
cognition.

<p>Next, your paper should describe <em>two</em> implications for
the life situation derived from theories or experimental results in
cognitive psychology.  For each implication, you must accurately
summarize the relevant theory or result, concisely describe its
implication for the life situation, and describe a possible test of
the implication.

<p>When describing an experimental result, be sure to describe the
stimuli, task, procedure, independent variables and dependent
variables.

<p>When describing a theory, be sure to describe the representation
and process assumed by the theory, if possible.

<p>In outline form, the paper is structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation.
<li>Implications from cognitive psychology:
	<ol>
	<li>Implication #1.
		<ul>
		<li>Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	<li>Implication #2.
		<ul>
		<li>Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	</ol>
</ul>

<a name="example">
Below is an example of a paper.  This is only an abbreviated sketch of
a paper, and it is incomplete in its details. The papers you submit
should be written more carefully.  <em>Because I have provided this
outline, you may not write a paper on this topic (imagery in athletic
practice) for credit!</em>

<p><center> Sample Abbreviated Paper: 
<br><strong>Mental Imagery in
Learning to Ice Skate</strong></center>

<ul> 

<li><em>Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation: 
Mental rehearsal of ice skating.</em> <p>In trying to improve
performance in a new skill such as ice skating, I find that it helps
to <em>imagine</em> skating when off the ice.  My imagery emphasizes
smooth, fluid execution of various maneuvers.  This is not just
fantasized glory, but concentrated mental rehearsal of specific
realistic actions.  This mental rehearsal seems to form a cognitive
"rut" that can be more easily followed when I subsequently perform the
actual, physical skating.  (For more information about this
phenomenon, see the newspaper article reprinted on pp. 202-203 of
Reed, 4th Ed.)

<p><li><em>Implications from cognitive psychology.</em>

	<ol>
	<p><li><em>Implication #1: Failure of reality monitoring.</em> 
		<ul>

		<p><li><em>Statement of theory or laboratory
result.</em> <p>In an experiment conducted by Johnson, Raye, Wang and
Taylor (1979), participants were shown either pictures of objects or
names of these objects.  When shown a name, the participant was
instructed to imagine the object named.  Two important independent
variables were the number of times an object's picture appeared, and
the number of times an object's name appeared.  After exposure to the
pictures and names, participants were given an unexpected test in
which they had to estimate the number of times they saw an item's
picture.  The crucial dependent variable, therefore, was the judged
number of times a picture was seen.  The results were that estimates
increased not only as a function of the actual number of times a
picture was presented, but also as a function of the number of times
the object was merely imagined. Thus, people confused imagining a
picture with actually seeing a picture. (For more details, see
pp. 210-214 of Reed, 4th Ed.)

		<p><li><em>Specific implication for life
situation.</em> <p>This result suggests that if people vividly imagine
performing an athletic skill such as skating, they will have
difficulty distinguishing the number of times that they actually went
skating from the number of times that they merely imagined skating.
It also implies that if people imagined some particular action, such
as a jump, then their estimates of the number of times they've
actually jumped should be inflated by the number of times they've
merely imagined jumping.  In other words, people won't be able to
fully distinguish reality from imagination. This implication
extrapolates the laboratory situation, which was based on memory for
external static objects, to a real life situation that involves
internal action.

		<p><li><em>Possible test of the implication.</em>
<p>This implication could be tested by having different participants
in a skating class perform certain maneuvers (such as turns, stops,
jumps, etc.) a specific number of times, and also having them imagine
these maneuvers a certain number of times.  After the class, students
would be asked to estimate how many times they actually executed the
various maneuvers.  The implication would be confirmed if people's
estimates were positively influenced by the number of times they
imagined the maneuvers.

		</ul>

	<p><li><em>Implication #2: Mental imagery might have a speed
limit.</em>
		<ul>

		<p><li><em>Statement of theory or laboratory
result.</em> <p>Shepard and Metzler found that response times, to
match two complex figures, increased linearly with the angle of
rotation between the two figures.  One explanation of their result is
that mental rotation has a maximal speed; consequently, larger angles
demand greater time to mentally traverse. (In your paper, you would
explicitly specify the stimuli, task, independent and dependent
variables, etc. For more details, see pp.197-199 of Reed, 4th Ed.)

		<p><li><em>Specific implication for life
situation.</em> <p>Does this imply that there is a speed limit for
athletic imagery as well?  That is, does the speed limit apply only to
complex geometric figures, or does the speed limit also apply to
imagery of personal action?  For example, if imagining a spin during a
jump, will imagination be able to keep up with real life spinning?
Will athletes sometimes imagine things too slowly?  And if so, will
this have detrimental effects instead of beneficial effects, contrary
to what coaches believe?

		<p><li><em>Possible test of the implication.</em>
<p>To test this implication, we first need to determine whether people
can imagine athletic actions in real time.  One possible way to do
this would be to have athletes imagine various maneuvers, and press a
button at the moments their imagined maneuvers begin and end.  We
could then measure to what extent the durations of imagined actions
corresponded with real actions.  If imagined actions are in fact much
slower than real actions, then we could go on to test whether this
too-slow imagination is detrimental.  We might have some people
imagine only complex events that cannot be imagined as quickly as real
time, and have other people imagine only simple events that can be
imagined as quickly as real time, and then assess any improvement (or
worsening) in actually executing the skill.  If it turns out that too
slow imagery is detrimental, we've learned something useful!

		</ul>

<!--

	<p><li><em>Implication #3. Mental imagery might suffer
distortions.</em>
		<ul>

		<li><em>Statement of theory or laboratory result.</em>
We learned in lecture about various systematic mistakes people make
when judging relative locations of cities.  One explanation of these
mistakes is that mental map reading suffers from systematic
distortions, called alignment and rotation heuristics.  (For more
details, see the article by B. Tversky, 1981, cited in the textbook.)

		<li><em>Specific implication for life situation.</em>
Does this imply that athletic imagery will also suffer distortions?
For example, will skaters imagine the angle of their bodies or skates
incorrectly?  Will this have detrimental effects for performance?

		<li><em>Possible test of the implication.</em>
As with the previous implication, testing this implication would have
to proceed in two steps:  First, determine whether there is any
distortion in imagery.  Second, if there is distortion, assess its
effect on performance.  Testing for distortion in imagery could be
analogous to what Tversky did.  For example, skaters could be asked
about the relative locations of their hands and feet at a particular
time in a maneuver.  If distortions do exist and they are detrimental,
then we've learned something useful, and can proceed to try to
compensate for these distortions.

<a name="restrict"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>
Each paper's <em>topic</em> must correspond with concurrent course topic.
</h2>

<p>For each of the four relevance papers, the implications must draw
from material in the corresponding, concurrent course topics.  Thus,
the first relevance paper must draw implications from topics studied
in weeks 1-4, such as perception and attention, etc.  The second paper
must draw implications from topics studied during weeks 5-8, such as
memory and imagery.  And so on for the third and fourth papers.

<p>Implications from non-concurrent course topics will not be given
credit!  If, for example, you write about implications from
attentional research for your third relevance paper, you won't get
credit.

<p>The main <em>purpose</em> of this requirement is to make sure you
consider real-life implications from material <em>throughout</em> the
course.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<a name="proposal"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>Paper <em>proposals</em> and <em>discussions</em>.</h2>

<p>Before each paper is due, you must write a very brief proposal.  In
the proposal, describe the life situation and two implications from
cognitive psychology.  You only need to make very brief descriptions
in your proposal; just a sentence or two for each part of the paper.

<p>Make two copies of your proposal, which you should bring to class
the day that the proposal is due.  You hand in one copy at the
beginning of class.  Keep the other copy for classroom discussion.

<p>In classroom discussion, we will split up into groups.  Each member
of the group will briefly tell the group about his or her
proposal. The other members provide constructive feedback about the
proposal: Does the proposer understand the experiment or theory
correctly? Does the application to a real-life situation make sense?
Is the test of the implication appropriate?  

<p>After all members have described their proposals, the group will
decide which proposed implication is the most viable and interesting.
Your group decides exactly what is "interesting", but often an
implication is interesting if it is unexpected or somehow makes a
quantum leap from the laboratory to life.  After all the groups have
decided on their most interesting proposals, the author of each
group's most interesting proposal will briefly summarize his or her
idea to the whole class.

<p><em>A primary purpose of the group discussion is for you to get
informative feedback about your ideas.  You will not get feedback from
the instructor or assistant on the written proposal you hand in.
Therefore, make sure that you present your ideas clearly and get
genuine evaluative feedback from the members of your group.</em> (The
copy you hand in is just for administrative purposes, so you get the
points for completing the proposal.)

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<a name="grading"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>Criteria for <em>grading</em> of papers and proposals.</h2>

<p><em>Proposals</em> that are (1) turned in on time (at the beginning
of the appropriate class) and (2) complete in content (including a
life situation and two implications) will be awarded 3
points. Proposals are not evaluated for quality or accuracy of
content. No written feedback is supplied by the instructor or
assistant on the proposals; such feedback occurs during the in-class
group discussion.

<p><em>Full papers</em> are graded as follows.  Each content section
gets 0-2 points, as shown below:

<ul>
<li>(3 pts.) Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation.
<li>Implications from cognitive psychology:
	<ol>
	<li>Implication #1.
		<ul>
		<li>(4 pts.) Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>(4 pts.) Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>(4 pts.) Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	<li>Implication #2.
		<ul>
		<li>(4 pts.) Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>(4 pts.) Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>(4 pts.) Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	</ol>
</ul>

<p>4 points are awarded to sections that clearly and concisely include
all the relevant details necessary to explain the theory, implication,
or test.

<p>2 points are awarded for sections that are approximately correct, but
that lack some important detail or include some erroneous statement,
or that are vague or unclear.

<p>0 points are given for sections that are essentially redundant with
other sections, or which are excessively brief, vague or obscure, or
which are fundamentally wrong.

<p>The above criteria presume that the topic is concurrent
with the course material (see the <a href="#restrict">topic
restrictions</a> above).  If the topic does not correspond with
concurrent course material, no credit can be awarded.

<!--
<p><em><a href="releval.html">Evaluations</a></em> of the relevance
paper assignments are awarded 2 points, if they are submitted at the
appropriate time.
-->

<p><em>Summary:</em> 
The proposal is worth up to 3 points.
The papers are worth up to 27 points.
<!-- The evaluation is worth up to 2 points. -->
Thus, each paper assignment is worth up to 30 points total.

<h2>Hints and comments.</h2>


<p><strong>Common problems with papers:</strong>

<ul>

<p><li><strong>Not drawing from concurrent course material.</strong>
Your implications for each paper must draw from concurrent topics in
the course.  See the <a href="#restrict">topic restrictions</a> above.

<p><li><strong>Misunderstanding or misstating an effect or
theory.</strong> Whenever you're making a connection with something
discussed in class, make sure you correctly understand and clearly
state that something!  When describing an experimental result, be sure
to describe the stimuli, task, procedure, independent variables and
dependent variables.  When describing a theory, be sure to describe
the representation and process assumed by the theory, if possible.

<p><li><strong>Renaming the same point two or three times, trying to
make several implications out of one.</strong> The three different
implications need to be three <em>different</em> implications.

<p><li><strong>Improperly using "affect" and "effect":</strong> 

<p><center>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 width=90%>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align=center>AFFECT</td>
<td align=center>EFFECT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noun</td>
<td>"affect" as a noun means an emotion.  This usage is uncommon in
everday conversation, but does occur often in technical writing.
When spoken, the first syllable is stressed.
<p><em>The actor conveyed intense affect.</em></td>

<td>"effect" as a noun means a change, or a consequence.
<p><em>The manipulation produced a significant effect.</em></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Verb</td>

<td>"affect" as a verb means to influence.
When spoken, the second syllable is stressed.
<p><em>Depth of processing affects memory.</em></td>

<td>"effect" as a verb means to bring about, or to bring into being.
This usage is fairly rare.  <p><em>Utilization of interactive imagery
effects correct recall.</em></td>

</tr>

</table>
</center>

<p><li><strong>Piling on more than two implications.</strong> You
can probably think of dozens of possible implications, but choose
<em>the best two</em>. Think deeply about these bests ones, and then
write carefully about them.  You only get credit for the first two
implications you describe.


<p><li><strong>Saying way too much or too little about a theory or
experiment.</strong> Say just enough to express clearly exactly what
you think the application is.  Please do not "parrot" the whole
complex design of an experiment just to show you know it; you'd
actually just be showing a lack of discretion and lack of clarity.  On
the other hand, don't just "telegraph" a topic, leaving important
aspects merely implied.  Be explicit about exactly what you think the
important point is, but don't pack it with unnecessary baggage.

</ul>
