<p>Keeping your knowledge <em>organized</em> is crucial for
understanding and for remembering.  The time you spend figuring
out how it all fits together will pay off in terms of
performance on exams and in terms of your enjoyment of the
class!

<p>To help digest the readings, it's crucial always to keep in
mind the "big picture" --- <em>why</em> is the author
discussing this particular thing in this particular place?
What point is it supposed to be illustrating or demonstrating?
Be sure you can answer this question; if you can't, then you
don't really understand!

<p>The knowledge organization diagram from the syllabus is
intended to help you keep the big picture.  Whenever you read
about an experiment in the book, or hear about one in lecture,
you should be able to fill in all the leaves of the knowledge
organization tree.  Sometimes an experment is discussed in
terms of its results only, without a theory thoroughly
described.  In these cases, you should at least be aware that
if a theory were proposed, it would have to specify
representation and process.


<a name="stmduration"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> could you please review the brown/peterson experiment
> ... i only have the peterson/peterson experiment in my
> notes.
</pre>

<p>They are the same thing.  At about the same time as
Peterson and Peterson did their classic experiment on STM
in the United States, a researcher named Brown did a
comparable experiment in the United Kingdom.  So the
method is often called the "Brown/Peterson paradigm."

<p>(Don't confuse this "Brown" with the "Brown et al. (1977)"
experiment regarding <a href="#mugshots">eye-witness identification
after seeing mug shots</a>.)

<a name="decay"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> I have a question regarding the Brown/Peterson paradigm
> for measuring the duration of STM.  I understand that the
> explanation for the results found is decay and/or
> interference.  But I am unclear on how the boat and
> refrigerator metaphor you discussed in class is divided
> into representation and process.
</pre>

<p>The boat and refrigerator metaphors were intended to
clarify the distinction between decay and interference.

<p>The boat metaphor: In this metaphor, an item to
remember is a boat in a busy harbor. Remembering an item
is like being able to see the boat from the pier.  You
might lose sight of the boat two different ways: The boat
might sink (decay), or it might be occluded by other
boats (interference).  So the representation is the boat,
the process is either sinking (decay) or occlusion by
other boats (interference).

<p>The refrigerator metaphor: An item to remember is a
tub of leftovers in the frig.  Remembering an item is
being able to see it when you open the frig door.  You
might lose sight of the item two different ways: It might
spoil and be unrecognizable (decay), or it might be
occluded by other leftovers that get placed in front of
it (interference). So the representation is the tub of
leftovers, the process is spoilage (decay) or occlusion
by other leftovers (interference).

<p>The two metaphors motivate the Waugh & Norman
experiment as well.  You can think about how decay and
interference might be independently manipulated in the
two metaphorical situations, and how that corresponds to
what Waugh and Norman did.


<a name="release"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> could you briefly describe the implication of the
> proactive interference on stm/ltm distinction?  thank
> you for your time.
</pre>

<p>Proactive inhibition (PI) and release from PI are
discussed at length in your textbook on pages 84-86.

<p>An implication for the STM/LTM distinction is that STM
cannot be purely acoustic, because PI and release from PI
show that STM is affected by semantic information.  This
type of argument is mentioned on p.151 of your textbook
(middle of the page), although it doesn't mention PI
specifically.


<a name="chunking"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> I also have a question regarding the DeGroot
> experiment on STM of Chess positions by experts or
> novices.  The explanation I understand for this
> experiment is that experts depended on their abilitys

> Thank you so much for you time.
</pre>

<p>You should also be sure to understand how DeGroot et
al. ruled out other possible explanations.  How did the
experiment rule out the possibility that the experts
really were not remembering the board but were in fact
just guessing the position?  How did the experiment rule
out the possibility that experts just had good memory for
<em>any</em> configuration of chess pieces, not just for
"chunk-able" configurations?

<p>I did not interpret these results in terms of
representation and process, but if I had, the
representation would have emphasized meaningful
configurations, or "chunks," and the process would have
emphasized how such chunks are learned and recognized.


<a name="stmscanning"><p><hr></a>

</pre>

<p>It is not crucial to memorize the flow chart
exactly.  You should know the logic of the various
scanning models, though.  In fact, you should be able
to re-create the basics of the flowcharts on your own
if you really understand the processes - but you won't
be required to do that on the exam.


<a name="depth"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> With regards to the level of processing approach and
> the depth of processing what are the differences, I
> am a bit confused. Is one better than the other? Or

</pre>

<p><em>Depth</em> of processing and <em>levels</em> of
processing refer to the same thing.  They are entirely
synonymous.  When something is processed more deeply,
it is being processed at a deeper level.  The notion is
that there are different levels of processing, at
different "depths".  Sorry for any confusion.



<a name="state"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
>  what is state dependency?  Thank you!
</pre>

<p>This is merely encoding specificity when the context
is <em>internal</em>.  That is, recall of information is
better when your internal state (e.g., mood, sobriety)
matches the internal state you had when you initially
learned the information. 



<a name="mugshots"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> what is the main point of Brown's experiment?
</pre>

<p>You mean the Brown et al. (1977) experiment on pp.134-6 of the
text?  (Not to be confused with the Brown experiment on <a
href="#stmduration">duration of STM</a>.)

<p>The main point of the results was that, after seeing mug shots, not
only did correct identification of suspects increase (from 51% to
65%), but so did incorrect accusations of innocent people (from 8% to
20%)!  In fact, when measured by <strong>d'</strong>, the ability to
distinguish between "guilty" and "innocent" actually got
<em>worse</em> after seeing the mug shots, although the textbook never
explicitly connects the preceding discussion of d' with this aspect of
the experiment.



<a name="confabulation"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> i am having trouble finding info on confabulated and

</pre>

<p>It's not in the textbook (although there is some
related material we'll encounter in later chapters).
It was only discussed in class.  The main point is that
it's surprisingly easy to implant false (confabulated)
memories which feel and look real (veridical).  This
does not imply that all memories are false, only that
it is surprisingly possible for them to be false.

<p>A veridical suppressed memory would be a genuine
memory that has been repressed (and then recovered).
It is controversial whether such memories really occur.
Some researchers argue that emotionally charged events
are the ones remembered best, e.g., post-traumatic
stress disorder is a result of remembering trauma too
well.  Other researchers argue that memories of
tramautic events really can be suppressed, especially
when experienced in childhood, and there are various
theories regarding the mechanisms of suppression and
memory recovery.
