</h2></center>


<p>First, be sure to review the <strong><a
href="goals.html#wk8">instructional goals</a></strong> of weeks 8
through 11.  And of course, know how to use the knowledge organization
diagram in the <a href="syllabus.html#goals">syllabus</a>.

<p>Essay Question Topics:

<ul>

<li><a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/prop_rep_abstract.html">The
maze running demonstration</a> from class, and how the result can be
<a href="mazemodels.html">explained by imagistic (analogue)
representation and how it can be explained by propositional (symbolic)
representation</a>.

<li>The experiment by Lutz & Lutz on imagery in advertising.

<li>How concept learning and scientific method are (or are not)
analogous.

<li>How Rosch et al. found evidence that there is a basic level in
natural categories.  Specifically know both the attribute-listing
experiment and the shape-identification experiment (see the textbook).

<li><a href="semorgmodels.html">Know how the feature-comparison model
accounts for the relatedness effect in sentence verification.</a>

<li><a href="semorgmodels.html">Know how the ACT model accounts for
the fan effect.</a>

</ul>

<p>Multiple Choice Question Topics:

<ul>

<li>Know how imagery can be used to improve athletic performance.

<li>Know about the effects of interactive imagery in free recall and
in associate-cued recall.

<li>Know how imagery can explain the results of the Shepard and
Metzler mental rotation experiment.

<li>Know what "reality monitoring" is, and how good people are at it.

<li>Know about the memorability of imagable (concrete) words. (Reed

results were explained.

<li>Know about rule-learning strategies in concept learning.

<li>Know what types of concept rules are easiest and hardest to learn.

<li>Know about the extent of feature overlap in super-ordinate, basic,
and sub-ordinate categories.

<li><a href="catmodels.html">Know what models of categorization can
account for prototypicality effects.</a>

<li>Know what family resemblance is (in the context of
categorization).

<li>Know the difference between path priming (Collins & Quillian) and
semantic-associate priming (Meyers & Schvaneveldt).

<li><a href="semorgmodels.html">Know what various effects the
spreading activation model can or cannot account for.</a>

<li><a href="semorgmodels.html">Know the hierarchical (or category
size) effect, the reverse hierarchical effect, the typicality effect,
the relatedness effect, and the fan effect.</a>

<li>Know how the ACT model deals with effects of integration of
sentences. 

<li>Know about the influence of causal relations on the fan
effect. (Oops! In the 4th edition of Reed's book, this information has
been moved from Chapter 9 to Chapter 11.  Please read from the
