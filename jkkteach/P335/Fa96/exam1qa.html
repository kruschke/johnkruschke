<p>Keeping your knowledge <em>organized</em> is crucial for
understanding and for remembering.  The time you spend figuring
out how it all fits together will pay off in terms of
performance on exams and in terms of your enjoyment of the
class!

<p>To help digest the readings, it's crucial always to keep in
mind the "big picture" --- <em>why</em> is the author
discussing this particular thing in this particular place?
What point is it supposed to be illustrating or demonstrating?
Be sure you can answer this question; if you can't, then you
don't really understand!

<p>The knowledge organization diagram from the syllabus is
intended to help you keep the big picture.  Whenever you read
about an experiment in the book, or hear about one in lecture,
you should be able to fill in all the leaves of the knowledge
organization tree.  Sometimes an experment is discussed in
terms of its results only, without a theory thoroughly
described.  In these cases, you should at least be aware that
if a theory were proposed, it would have to specify
representation and process.

</pre>

<p>Any theory of a cognitive phenomenon must specify the
<em>representation</em> of information and the
<em>processes</em> that act on it.  The representation
includes the <em>content</em> of the information, i.e., what
is represented, and the <em>format</em> or organization of
the information.

<p>Example: In finding out a phone number, the input is a
person's name and the output is his or her phone number.
One theory of how this is accomplished claims that the
information represented in memory is a set of names with
corresponding phone numbers (that's the content), arranged
alphabetically by last name (that's the format).  When a
name is presented, the memory is searched by starting in the
list approximately where names with the corresponding first
letter are stored, and then scanning forward or back toward
the correct position in the list (that's the process).  In
class I also presented an alternative theory of finding out
a phone number.

<p>Several other examples were presented in the topic of
pattern recognition; e.g., <a href="#iamodel">the
interactive activation model</a> of the word-superiority
effect.

<a name="iamodel"><p><hr></a>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>In general, <em>representation</em> consists of what
information is there (contents) and how it is formatted or
organized.  The interactive activation model represents the
following information (contents): features (of letters),
letters, and words. This information is organized or formatted
into three corresponding levels.

<p>The <em>processing</em> in the model is spreading
activation, from features to letters to words.  Crucially, to
account for the word-superiority effect, there is also
spreading activation from the words back down to the letters.

</pre>

<p>An illusory conjunction is the perception of a combination of features
that are not really combined in the world.  For example, seeing a red
A and a green B where there is really a green A and a red B.

<p>Illusory conjunctions are predicted and explained by Treisman's
Feature Integration Theory, in which features are pre-attentively
registered, but then correctly combined only with subsequent
attention.  If attention is distracted, illusory conjunctions might
(and sometimes do) occur.

<p>Notice that these ideas -- about the role of attention -- fit nicely
with Sperling's (and other's) ideas about iconic memory, and Rock &
Gutman's ideas about attention and shape perception.

<a name="eventattn"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> Are you going to discuss in more detail the Neiser and
> Becklen experiment since we are responsible for the
> information on the exam and because it is not discussed in

> you.
</pre>

<p>The point of the Neisser and Becklen experiment was simply
that we can selectively attend to whole <em>events</em> (such
as games), even when we are looking at both events
simultaneously.  In fact, it is very difficult to divide
attention across both events, even though both events are
visually in the same place.

<p>This happens in everyday life when we look out a window
during twilight, and we can see outside or the reflection of
inside merely by shifting attention from one event to the
other.  The reason for doing the experiment was so this
everyday phenomenon could be carefully controlled and measured,
to be sure that what we merely feel in everyday life really is
how we perform when various extraneous influences are
eliminated.

<p>The overall point of my discussion of attention to
locations, objects and events was that we do not attend
<em>only</em> to locations, but also to objects and to whole
events.  We do not attend only to events or only to objects; we
can attend at all three levels.  Indeed, attention occurs at
every level of processing in perception and cognition.

<a name="preatt"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> I'm having trouble trying to figure out what exactly you

</pre>

<p>First, know the difference.  Various theories assert that
some information is extracted or registered pre-attentively,
but other types of information need attentive processing.

<p>Second, know which theories rely on the distinction. This
distinction shows up in theories of results from the partial
report procedure (Sperling, Rumelhart), perception of shape
(Rock & Gutman), illusory conjunctions (Treisman), dichotic
listening (Broadbent, Treisman, et al.), etc.

<p>Third, know that it is really just a theoretical
distinction, and might or might not be a correct description
of human cognition.  That is, there might be kinds of
attention happening at all levels of processing in human
perception and cognition, not just at one dividing line
between pre-attentive and post-attentive.


<a name="filtertheory"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> Can you help me understand why Broadbent's filter theory
> of attention is incomplete? Thanks
</pre>

<p>Broadbent's filter theory asserted that pre-attentive
processing was very low-level in terms of the type of
information extracted, so that attention could be directed
to low-level, "physical" aspects of stimuli such as pitch,
location, etc., but not to high-level aspects such as
meaning.

<p>Subsequent data from Moray and Treisman et al. (p.54 of
Reed) were problematic because they showed that attention
could be diverted by the meaning of stimuli.  So Broadbent's
filter theory is incomplete.
