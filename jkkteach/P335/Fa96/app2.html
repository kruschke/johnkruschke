<center> <h2>Additional Comments on Application Papers and
Proposals</h2></center>

<p><hr>

<p><strong>Common problems with paper proposals:</strong>

<ul>

<p><li><strong>Misunderstanding what an "implication" is.</strong> An
implication starts with some specific result or theory discussed in
class, and ends with a specific implication for the particular
real-world situation in your article.  That is, <em>apply</em> the
general principle to specific real-world situation.  This is why the
assignment is called an "applications" paper.

<p><li><strong>Not distinguishing links from implications.</strong> A
link just points from the article to something comparable in class.
An implication points the opposite direction, and adds new information
and possibilities.

<p><li><strong>Misunderstanding or misstating an effect or
theory.</strong> Whenever you're making a connection with something
discussed in class, make sure you correctly understand and clearly
state that something!

<p><li><strong>Not considering topics from the whole course.</strong>
When pondering links and implications, consider the whole course, from
perception through attention and memory and imagery to categorization,
semantic organization, language, and reasoning.  Don't get stuck
splitting hairs in a single sub-topic.  (See also the next point.)

<p><li><strong>Renaming the same link/implication two or three times,
trying to make several connections out of one.</strong> The five
different links and implications need to be five <em>different</em>
links and implications. (See also the previous point.)

<p><li><strong>Improperly using "affect" and "effect":</strong>

<tr>
<td>Noun</td>
<td>"affect" as a noun means an emotion.
<br>The actor showed strong affect.</td>
<td>"effect" as a noun means a change.
<br>The manipulation produced a significant effect.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Verb</td>
<td>"affect" as a verb means to influence.
<br>Depth of processing affects memory.</td>
<td>"effect" as a verb means to bring about. 
<br>Interactive imagery effects correct recall.</td>

<p><strong>The assignment asks for five links and five implications.
Is more better?</strong>

<br>No, definitely not.  You can probably think of dozens of possible
links and implications, but choose <em>the best five</em> of
each. Think deeply about those bests ones, and then write carefully
about them.

<p><strong>How much needs to be said about the "links"?</strong>

<br>Just enough to express clearly exactly what you think the link is.
Please do not "parrot" the whole design of a linked-to experiment just
to show you know it; you'd actually just be showing a lack of
discretion and lack of clarity.  On the other hand, don't just
"telegraph" a link, leaving important aspects merely implied.  Be
explicit about exactly what you think the link is, but don't pack it
with unnecessary baggage.

<p><strong>Implications usually suggest questions about the
application domain.  Do we need to provide answers to these
questions?</strong>

<br>No, you don't.  But it would indicate depth of thinking to suggest
methods by which you might answer the question.  For example, you
might propose an experiment to address the question.  But even this is
not necessary; what's most important is to express clearly exactly
what you think the implication is and why.
