What was going on? A roar of laughter from the aphasia ward,
just as the President's speech was coming on, and they had all
been so eager to hear the President speaking. ..
There he was, the old Charmer, the Actor, with his practised
rhetoric, his histrionisms, his emotional appeal-and all the pa-
tients were convulsed with laughter. Well, not all: some looked
bewildered, some looked outraged, one or two looked apprehen-
sive, but most looked amused. The President was, as always, mov-
ing-but he was moving them, apparently, mainly to laughter.
What could they be thinking? Were they failing to understand
him? Or did they, perhaps, understand him all too well?
It was often said of these patients, who though intelligent had
the severest receptive or global aphasia, rendering them incapable
of understanding words as such, that they none the less understood
most of what was said to them. Their friends, their relatives, the
nurses who knew them well, could hardly believe, sometimes, that
they were aphasic.
This was because, when addressed naturally, they grasped some
or most of the meaning. And one does speak 'naturally', naturally.
Thus, to demonstrate their aphasia, one had to go to extraor-
dinary lengths, as a neurologist, to speak and behave un-naturally,
to remove all the extraverbal cues-tone of voice, intonation,
suggestive emphasis or inflection, as well as all visual cues (one's
expressions, one's gestures, one's entire, largely unconscious, per-
sonal repertoire and posture): one had to remove all of this (which
might involve total concealment of one's person, and total deper-
sonalisation of one's voice, even to using a computerised voice
