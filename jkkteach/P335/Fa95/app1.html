<h3>Further explanation of the paper structure</h3>

The <a href="syllabus.html#applications">syllabus</a> introduces the
applications paper assignments.  Here is some further explication of
the structure required in the paper.<p>

The three parts of the paper can be explained as follows.  Imagine the
information in the article you find as a set of "factoids." You can
think of each factoid as a point in a set, like this:

<pre>
   Article
   +-----+
   | . . |  (The points indicate factoids.)
   |  .  |
   | .   |
   |   . |
   +-----+
</pre>

Your first job in the paper is to <em>highlight and summarize</em> the
points that are relevant to our class:

<pre>
   Article
   +-----+
   | o . |  (The circles indicate factoids
   |  o  |   that have been highlighted in
   | .   |   your summary.)
   |   o |
   +-----+ 
</pre> 

Now imagine all the material in class as a set of concepts (actually a
highly structured and organized set of concepts):

<pre>
                      Class Concepts      
                   +---------------------+
   (Each point     |     .        .      |
    indicates      |   .     .   .       |
    a concept.)    |       .          .  |
                   |     .   .      .    |
                   |  .         .        |
                   |   .   .     .       |
                   |           .       . |
                   +---------------------+
</pre>

Your second job in the paper is to <em>link</em> the relevant article
factoids with appropriate concepts from class.  For example, you could
say that a particular fact in the article is an example of a
phenomenon discussed in class.  In terms of the diagram, you are
pointing from a factoid in the article to a concept in class:

<pre>
   Article            Class Concepts      
   +-----+         +---------------------+
   | o==================>o        .      |
   |  o=====================>o   .       |
   | .   |         |       .          .  |
   |   o================>o   .      .    |
   +-----+         |  .         .        | 
                   |   .   .     .       |
	           |           .       . |
	           +---------------------+
</pre>

Your third job in the paper is to draw <em>implications</em> from the
class concepts to the article.  Consider a variety of class concepts
and their implications. In terms of the diagram, implications are
connections from various class concepts back to the article:

<pre>
   Article            Class Concepts      
   +-----+         +---------------------+
   | o<=================>o        .      |
   | ^o<====================>o   .       |
   | ^   |         |       .          .  |
   | ^ o<===============>o   .      .    |
   +-^-^-+         |  .         .        | 
     ^ ^<==============o   .     .       |
     ^<========================o       . |
                   +---------------------+
</pre>

This third part of the paper is where you can be most thoughtful, and
is supposed to be the most interesting part of the paper for you.
It is your chance to explore what the various theories and concepts
imply for real life.

<h2>
General Comments for Applications Paper 1.
<br>
</h2>
</center>

It helps to mark explicitly the organization of your paper (something
like "Summary of Real-Life Situation," "Links to Course Material," and
"Implications of Course Material for the Real-Life Situation") so that
I can see better what you doing where.  <p>

<strong>Common problems regarding the article summary:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Not indicating when you are summarizing and when you are drawing
your own conclusions or interpreting.

<li>Not defining terminology you take from the article.

<li>Not indicating the source you are summarizing.

<li>Not mentioning a clearly relevant point from the article (i.e.,
making the summary a little <em>too</em> brief).

</ul>

<strong>Common problems regarding links to course topics:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Mentioning only a few of the possible links.

<li>Describing class topics "from thin air" and not clearly explaining
the link to the article.

<li>Interpreting a class topic incorrectly.
</ul>

<strong>Common problems regarding implications:</strong>

<ul>

<li>The goal of the implications section is to discuss various
theories and phenomena in class and find implications for the
real-life situation that are not explicitly discussed.  E.g., for
pattern recognition, we know from class that context is important.
Does the real-life article discuss the role of context, and if not,
how could context play a role? As another example, for the topic of
attention, we know that distracted attention can lead to illusory
conjunctions or misperceived shape.  Does that occur in the real-life
situation or could it?  Etc., etc.  <em>In writing this section, go
through the topics discussed in class and textbook, and see what they
imply for the real-life situation.</em>

<li>Points could be lost for missing some implications, or
interpreting a class topic incorrectly.

</ul>

<strong>Common problems regarding citation and source:</strong>

<ul>

<li>You must give the complete and explicit citation: Author, date,
article title, newspaper or magazine title, and page numbers.

<li>For Web items, give the complete URL.

<li>The assignment explicitly asks for articles from the popular
press, not the academic press.  Academic articles (for which the
authors are not paid, there are no advertisements, and articles are
peer reviewed) can be used for reference, but should NOT be the
primary target of your paper.  The articles should discuss real-life
applications, not just laboratory experiments.

</ul>
