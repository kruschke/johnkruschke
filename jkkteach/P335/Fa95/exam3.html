First, be sure to review the <strong><a

<li>Know the experiment by Lutz & Lutz on imagery in advertising.

<li>Know the maze running demonstration from class, and how the result

be explained by propositional (symbolic) representation.

<li>Know how concept learning and scientific method are (and aren't)
analogous.

<li>Know how Rosch et al. found evidence that there is a basic level
in natural categories.  Specifically know both the attribute-listing

effect in sentence verification.

account for.

<li>Know the hierarchical (or category size) effect, the reverse
hierarchical effect, the typicality effect, the relatedness effect,
