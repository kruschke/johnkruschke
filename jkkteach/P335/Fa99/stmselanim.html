<p><h2>Animated flowchart for self-terminating serial search of
short-term memory (STM)</h2>

<p>In the diagram below, each stage is highlighted as it occurs.
Along with the highlighting, the real-time duration of the stage is
indicated, and the <em>elapsed time</em> is incremented.  (The
durations of each stage are the same as those hypothesized in the
description in <a href="stmscan.html">Homework 2</a>.)  As each item
in STM is checked, a check mark appears next to the item.

<p>As the animation proceeds, watch how the elapsed time increases
with each stage, and watch how each item is checked in STM.

<p>The animation automatically restarts, in an infinite loop.  To stop
it, click the STOP button at the top of your web browser.  To start it
again, from the beginning, click the RELOAD button.
