<h2><a href="exam1.html">Exam 1</a> Review Topics</h2>

<p><font size=-1>
The exam consists of 34 multiple choice questions, each worth 3 points.
Here's an example of the type of multiple choice question:
<p>The results of the experiment by Phillips (1974) were interpreted to 
mean that the representation in iconic memory is like a template. What 
was the task in that experiment?
<br>(a) To indicate whether two briefly presented patterns were 
the same or different.
<br>(b) To identify as many letters as possible in a briefly flashed array.
<br>(c) To identify a briefly flashed letter in the context of other letters.
<br>(d) To quickly identify the letters b, d, p or q.
<br>(e) To suppress visual images of a white bear.
<p>This is not intended to be just a memorize-and-regurgitate kind of question.
You're not going to answer this very well just by memorizing lists of 
experiment names, tasks, stimuli, etc.  Instead, if you know the theoretical 
motivation of the experiment, then you'll know how the task that was used 
to test the theory is 
meaningfully implied, rather than just arbitrarily associated.
