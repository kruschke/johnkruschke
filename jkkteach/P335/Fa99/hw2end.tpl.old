<p><strong>The Underlying Structure of the Symptoms and
Diseases.</strong> The experiment was split into three phases: An
early training phase, when you learned about just two diseases; a
later training phase, when you learned about two new diseases along
with the earlier two; and then a testing phase, when you rated your
confidence that various symptom combinations indicated the different
diseases.

<p>The two diseases from the early training phase are shown in the
first two rows of Table 1.  The two diseases from the late training
phase are shown in the next two rows of Table 1.  Consider the first
case in Table 1, which includes the symptoms "back pain" and "ear
aches".  Its correct diagnosis was disease B.  Now look at the third
case of Table 1, and notice that it also has the symptom "back pain."
Its correct diagnosis was disease D (not disease B). Thus, the
symptom, "back pain," is an <em>imperfect</em> predictor of the
diseases.  The code in parentheses, "I1," next to the symptom "back
pain," denotes the fact that the symptom is an imperfect predictor.
Each symptom has a code next to it, e.g., "I1" or "PE1", which is used
as an abstract label for the symptom.  The correspondence of codes
with symptoms and diseases is summarized here:

Figure 1, below, shows which symptoms corresponded with which diseases
in the training phases of the experiment. You might find it helpful to
write the symptom names next to the abstract labels in Figure 1.
Study Figure 1 carefully; if you don't understand it, nothing that
follows will make any sense.

<p><strong>Summarize your data.</strong> You can see from Figure 1
that the structure of the diseases E1 and L1 was just copied for
diseases E2 and L2.  Therefore you can collapse your data across the
two structures, in order to get more stable estimates of your ratings.
For example, the rating you gave to disease E1 for symptoms I1 and PE1
can be collapsed with the rating you gave to disease E2 for symptoms
I2 and PE2.  Both ratings indicate your confidence that symptoms I and
PE indicate the <em>corresponding</em> early disease E.  As another
example, the rating you gave to disease E<strong>1</strong> for
symptom I<strong>2</strong> can be collapsed with the rating you gave
for disease E2 for symptom I1, because both ratings show your
confidence that symptom I indicates the early disease from the
<em>other</em> substructure.  Table 2, below, does this collapsing for
you.

<p><strong>A Theory of Attention Shifting during Learning.</strong>
What is happening in people's minds that makes them prefer diagnosis L
when presented with symptoms PE and PL, but prefer diagnosis E when
presented with symptom I?  One theory explains the phenomenon as
follows: In the first phase of learning, during which there are cases
of I+PE=>E (that is, symptoms I and E paired with disease E), people
learn about both symptoms.  The symptoms I and PE share predictive
strength, so that each has a moderately strong association with
disease E.  In the second phase of learning, after the learners
thoroughly know I+PE=>E, people see cases of I+PL=>L.  The shared
symptom I is misleading, because people have previously associated it
with disease E, not with disease L.  So, people <em>shift
attention</em> away from I, toward PL, to reduce their predictive
error.  Then they learn an association from PL to L.  This association
from PL to L must be fairly strong, because PL must by itself predict
L.  If people didn't shift attention away from symptom I when learning
about disease L, then it would be much more difficult to learn: As an
association from I to L was building up, it would conflict with the
previously learned association from I to E, and performance on cases
of both I+PL and I+PE would be diminished.  Figure 2, below, shows the
associations that are learned according to this simple theory of
attention shifting.

in Figure 1.  The right panel shows the learned associations, with the
thickness of the arrow indicating the strength of the associations,
according to the attention-shifting theory.
</font>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The attention-shifting theory says that stimuli are <em>actively
encoded</em> by learners.  That is, learners don't just passively
absorb everything in the stimulus indiscriminately.  Instead, people
selectively attend to specific parts of the stimulus, and then
remember what they have paid attention to.  But the theory goes beyond
that by predicting <em>what</em> people will attend to.  People are
predicted to divert attention away from aspects of the stimulus that
conflict with previous learning, and direct attention toward aspects
that don't conflict with, or are consistent with, previous learning.
That is, the theory predicts that people will shift attention to
reduce error, and then learn about what they are attending to.


<p><strong>A Formal Model.</strong> The theory described above can be
expressed in a formal (mathematical) model and simulated on a computer
to see how well it fits human preferences.  It is beyond the intended
scope of this assignment to delve into all the details of such a
model. We'll just consider some aspects of it, and you can see the
article cited at the end of this assignment for more details, if you
like.

<p>The foundation of the model is a simple connectionist network
(similar to the interactive activation model of letter recognition,
which you learned about in relation to the word-superiority effect).
Simple nodes represent symptoms or diseases, and weighted connections
represent learned associations.  One major function of this network is
to convert symptoms into confidences in the possible diagnoses.
Figure 3, below, specifies how the model performs this function. Read
the caption carefully, because understanding it is critical for
generating model predictions later.

<p>

<font size=-1><strong>Figure 3: A connectionist model of learned
associations.</strong> The <em>left panel</em> shows the general
situation.  When symptoms are presented, the corresponding symptom
nodes are activated (at the bottom of the network), with activation
denoted by a<sub>s</sub> as shown by the bottom equation. Activation
then propagates upward, across the weighted connections, to the
disease nodes. The weight on the connection from symptom s to disease
d is denoted w<sub>ds</sub>. The activation, a<sub>d</sub>, of the
disease nodes is the weighted sum of the symptom activations, as shown
by the middle equation. The disease activations are then converted
into confidences; confidence c<sub>D</sub> in a diagnosis D is modeled
as the activation a<sub>D</sub> of the corresponding disease relative
to the total activation of all diseases, as shown by the top equation.
The <em>right panel</em> shows a specific example, with connection
weights already established by learning with attention shifts, and
with the symptoms PE and I presented.  The activation of disease E was
computed as follows: a<sub>E</sub> = w<sub>E,PE</sub>*a<sub>PE</sub> +
w<sub>E,I</sub>*a<sub>I</sub> + w<sub>E,PL</sub>*a<sub>PL</sub> = .7*1
+ .3*1 + -.3*0 = 1.0.  The activation of disease L was computed
similarly: a<sub>L</sub> = w<sub>L,PE</sub>*a<sub>PE</sub> +
w<sub>L,I</sub>*a<sub>I</sub> + w<sub>L,PL</sub>*a<sub>PL</sub> =
-.1*1 + .1*1 + .9*0 = 0.0.  The confidence in diagnosing these
symptoms as disease E is given by computing the activation of disease
E relative to the total activation of all the dieseases.  Thus,
c<sub>E</sub> = a<sub>E</sub>/(a<sub>E</sub>+a<sub>L</sub>) =
1.0/(1.0+0.0) = 1.0.  The confidence in diagnosing this case as
disease L is given similarly: c<sub>L</sub> =
a<sub>L</sub>/(a<sub>E</sub>+a<sub>L</sub>) = 0.0/(1.0+0.0) = 0.0.

</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>A second major function of the model is learning the connection
weights.  The essential idea for understanding how the model learns is
<em>error reduction</em>.  On any trial of learning, the model makes
its diagnosis as described in Figure 3, and then the correct diagnosis
is supplied by the experimenter.  Any discrepancy, between the model's
predictions and the correct answer, constitutes an error.  The model
has attention strengths (not shown in Figure 3) on each symptom, and
these attention strengths are shifted to reduce error.  Then the model
adjusts the connection weights to reduce error further.  After several
trials of learning, the model is making accurate predictions, and so
there is no error, and so there is no further change of the weights.
An example of possible weights at the end of training is shown in the
right panel of Figure 3.  Notice that the weights are not as extreme
as suggested in Figure 2.  This is because attention shifting in the
model is not as extreme as suggested by Figure 2.  Nevertheless, the
asymmetry of Figure 2 is present in the example of Figure 3: The
weight from I to E (.3) is stronger than the weight from I to L (.1),
and the weight from PE to E (.7) is weaker than the weight from PL to
L (.9).

<p>In summary, the <em>representation</em> in this model is
simplistic: node activations represent the presence or absence of
corresponding symptoms or diseases.  The <em>processes</em> in this
model are twofold: For generating predictions, there is spreading
activation. For learning, there is error-driven attention shifting and
error-driven weight changing.

<!-- NEXT TIME:  MAKE THIS A QUESTION ABOUT CORRELATION, NOT MONOTONICITY -->
<!-- DEFINE CORRELATION -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the graph of predictions vs. data
<em>monotonically increasing</em>?  Are violations of monotonicity
small or severe? (We could analyze this statistically, of course, but
we will not do so for this exercise.)

<br><br><br><br>

<!-- NEXT TIME:  MAKE THIS A QUESTION ABOUT CORRELATION, NOT MONOTONICITY -->
<!-- DEFINE CORRELATION -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Consider a model with <em>no</em>
attention shifting.  This would lead to predictions as follows: For
the training cases, confidence would be high and accurate.  For case
I, confidence in E would equal confidence in L, with both at .5.
Similarly, for case PE+PL, confidence in E and L would both be .5.
Plot these predictions in Figure 4 (try to be neat, and keep the lines
and labels clear).  Label this line as "No Attn".  Is this set of
predictions monotonically increasing with your mean ratings, or is it
drastically nonmonotonic?

<br><br><br><br>

<!-- NEXT TIME:  MAKE THIS A QUESTION ABOUT CORRELATION, NOT MONOTONICITY -->
<!-- DEFINE CORRELATION -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which set of predictions - the ones of
the model with attention shifting, or the ones of the model with no
attention shifting - better fit your mean ratings?  That is, which set
of predictions is more nearly a monotonic function of your mean

but we will not do that for this exercise.)

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM EQUALITY.  THE TWO THEORIES MAKE DIFFERENT

<p><strong>So what?</strong> Selective attention is critical for
understanding human learning and memory, in both the laboratory and
natural settings.  Many laboratory phenomena which seem irrational,
such as the preference for later-learned categories addressed in this
exercise, are actually rational and adaptive if the goal is rapid
learning.  Moreover, materials to be learned can be organized to take
advantage of selective attention.

<p><strong>To learn more:</strong> This exercise is based on
experiments and models described at length by <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/baserate_abstract.html">
Kruschke, J. K. (1996). Base rates in category learning.  <em>Journal
of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em>,
<strong>22</strong>, 3-26.</a> This article shows detailed computer
simulations and quantitative fits of an attention-shifting model to
several sets of experimental data. This article also describes many
other models of learning that fail to account for human performance
because the models fail to include mechanisms for selective attention
during encoding.
