<h2>Exam 4 Review Topics
</h2>


<ul>

<li>General framework for defining a problem, and examples (start,
goal, operators, contraints; lecture).

<li>Deep Blue and computer problem solving vs. human problem solving
(lecture, see also pp. 364-365).

<li>Greeno's three types of problems and examples of each
(arrangement, structure induction, transformation; pp. 354-361).

<li>Representational desiderata for problem solving (lecture).

<li>Problem solving heuristics: means-ends analysis, subgoals,
hill-climbing, working backwards, and analogy (lecture and pp. 365-380).

<li>Experimental evidence for human use of hill-climbing in
problem solving (lecture - the Calvin and Hobbes problem, aka the
Missionaries and Cannibals problem).

<li>Analogical transfer, representational transfer, and applying prior
knowledge in problem solving (pp. 372-380, 390-391).

<li>Wason card selection task: In its abstract form, which cards are
correct and what error do people tend to make? (lecture, WWW,
pp. 387-390).

<li>Wason card selection task: The solution, and the four solution
strategies that people might use (lecture, pp. 387-390).

<li>Expertise and sensitivity to underlying structure in problems
(pp. 392-394).

<li>Effect of examples on creativity (pp. 402-404).

<li>The four conditions in Finke's studies of creative invention, and
which conditions were most productive (pp. 404-406).

<li>Decision making heuristics: Representativeness, availability,
anchoring and adjustment (lecture and pp. 421-426).

<li>Framing effects (primarily lecture; see also pp. 426-430).

<li>Expected value and expected utility (lecture and pp. 427-430).

<li>Information integration and the additive model (homework).

<li>Compensatory (e.g., additive and additive-difference models) and
non-compensatory (e.g., elimination by aspects) processes in making
choices, and how to tell which ones people are using (lecture and
pp.414-421).

<li>Stategies in decision making that depend on problem complexity, as
studied by Payne (pp. 419-421).

<li>Utilization of various risk dimensions, and method of duplex
gambles (pp. 430-432).

<li>Disease diagnosis by physicians: hypothesis generation,
evaluation, and final diagnosis (pp.433-435).

<li>Role of feelings in decision making (lecture and WWW re: Phineas
Gage).

<li>What are three possible ways of getting "common sense" into a
computer/robot? (video and web notes re: video).
