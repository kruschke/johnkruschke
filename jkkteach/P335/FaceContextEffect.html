<h1>Top-Down Context Effects:<br>
Semantic Priming of Familiar Faces</h1>
</center>

<font size=+1>

<p><strong>Experiment</strong> by Bruce and Valentine (1986).

<dl>

<p><dt><strong>
Stimuli and Procedure:
</strong>

<dd> Briefly (250 ms) show participant a "priming" face, then a brief
(500 ms) blank, then a "target" face.


<p><dt><strong>
Task:
</strong>

<dd> Participant must indicate as quickly as possible whether the
target face is familiar (i.e., recognizable).


<p><dt><strong>
Independent (Manipulated) Variable:
</strong>

<dd> Three types of priming face: (1)&nbsp;Unfamiliar;
(2)&nbsp;Familiar and not related to target; (3)&nbsp;Familiar and
related to target.

<p>For example:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="nixon.jpg"></td>
<td><img src="kissinger.jpg"></td>
<td><img src="presley.jpg"></td>
</tr><tr>
<td align=center>Target face<br>(Nixon)</td>
<td align=center>Related familiar face<br>(Kissinger)</td>
<td align=center>Unrelated familiar face<br>(Presley)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=3 align=center>(These are <em>not</em> faces used in the
original experiment!)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you were around in the early 1970's, or have studied that
period, then President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger are strongly related in your personal knowledge. But Elvis
Presley is probably not strongly related to Nixon in your knowledge,
unless you happened to have fixated on <a

meeting</a>.

<p><dt><strong>
Dependent (Measured) Variable:
</strong>

<dd>
Response time (RT).

<p><dt><strong>
Results:
</strong>

<dd>
<br><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10>
<tr><th colspan=3><font size=+1>
Mean RT for familiar targets (in msec)
</th></tr>
<tr>
<th valign=bottom><font size=+1>
Unfamiliar Prime
</th>
<th valign=bottom><font size=+1>
Familiar Unrelated Prime
</th>
<th valign=bottom><font size=+1>
Familiar Related Prime
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><font size=+1>827</td>
<td align=center><font size=+1>826</td>
<td align=center><font size=+1>716</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>The target is recognized faster when preceded by a familiar related prime.

Explanation:
</strong>

<dd> Burton, Bruce and Johnston (1990)
proposed a type of interactive activation model.

<p>The <em>representation</em> involves four levels of
representational elements, or "units": Feature units, face recognition
units, person identity units, and semantic information units.

<p>The <em>process</em> involves spreading of activation between
units. When a face is presented, its features are activated, and
activation spreads to connected face units, which are gradually
activated. When a face unit reaches a certain threshold activation,
the face is declared to be recognized. Activation continues to spread
over connections to other layers of units, such that the activation of
the priming face spreads through the semantic information units back
down to other, related person identity units and face recognition
units. Thus, faces that are meaningfully related to the prime get a
"head start" when the system tries to recognize them.
