<p><strong>Do not proceed unless you will have ten minutes of
uninterrupted and undistracted use of the computer.</strong> You will
also need a working printer, so be sure the printer is operational.

<p>You will see pairs of patterns. Each pattern looks (vaguely) like a
letter A, B, D, K or S. For each pair of letters, you must assign a
rating of similarity on a scale from 1 to 9, where
1 means least similar and 9 means most similar.

<p>Try to use the entire rating scale, from 1 to 9.  Don't just give
every pair about the same rating.  There are no right or wrong
ratings.  Give each combination the rating that seems appropriate to
you, while trying to use the entire rating scale from 1 to 9.

<p>You will see four pages of ten pairs per page.  After you have made
your ratings, your data will be shown to you, and you will see further
instructions.
