<p>We will roll dice to observe the influence of sample size and
population variance on statistical power.


<p>Suppose the "null" hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis we want to
reject) is that the mean value of a die is 3.0.  The alternative
hypothesis is that the mean value of the die is 3.5.  (Of course, our
real dice are assumed to be fair, so that their mean value is truly
3.5.)

<p>Please note that this exercise is only a rough approximation to the
power computations we've been doing with the normal distribution in
the textbook.  The population distribution of the die values is not
normal, and we have not here considered an <em>alpha</em> level for
determining the rejection criterion.

<p>The first exercise examines the probability of rejecting the null
hypothesis (i.e., the power) for two different sample sizes.

<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td>Number of dice in roll (i.e., the sample size)</td>
<td>Mean of <em>your</em> roll</td>
<td width=50%>List the means of everyone else in your class</td>
<td>Proportion of means greater than 3.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2</strong></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>10</strong></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For which sample size was there a higher proportion of means
greater than 3.0?


<p><hr width=60%>


<p>The second exercise examines the probbility of rejecting the null
hypothesis (i.e., the power) for two different population variances.

<p>To decrease the population variance, we will re-map the values of
the die: If it comes up as value <em>x</em>, count it as
(<em>x</em>/2)+1.75.

<p>First, verify that the remapped values still have mean 3.5.  In the
space below, compute the remapped value for all six values of the die,
and show that the mean of the remapped values is the same as the mean
of the original values. Is the range of the remapped values greater or
less than range of the original values?

<p><em>Roll two dice, and fill in the table below:</em>
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td>Actual values of two dice</td>
<td>Mean of actual values</td>
<td width=30%>List of means of actual values from everyone in your class</td>
<td>What proportion of means (of actual values) is above 3.0?</td>
<td>Remapped values of two dice</td>
<td>Mean of remapped values</td>
<td width=30%>List of means of remapped values from everyone in your class</td>
<td>What proportion of means (of remapped values) is above 3.0?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For which population, the original, or the smaller-variance
remapped, was there a higher proportion of means greater than 3.0?
