Homework 5. Due 10 October 2000.

<p>
In the book, <em>SPSS for Windows Step by Step</em>, see Ch. 11,
p. **. For this week, we focus on independent-samples t-tests.

<ol>

<p><li>(4 pts) t distribution: Use the linked <a
href="samplet2groups.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore sampling
distributions of <em>t</em>. The goal of this exercise is for you to
see how the t distribution is (or is not) affected by unequal
variances or unequal sample sizes.  Please run the file in SPSS and do
the following.

<ul>

<li>Find the lines in the SPSS syntax file that compute t with pooled
or unpooled variance. Mark these lines and annotate which is which.


<li>Equal variances and equal sample sizes: The first sampling
distribution assumes normal populations of equal means, equal
variances, and equal sample sizes. This is the null hypothesis on
which are based the critical values of t in the table in the appendix
of the textbook. From "statistics" output table, average the
magnitudes of the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles, and average the magnitudes
of the 5 and 95 percentiles. Write these averages next to the
table. Now look up the corresponding critical values of t in the t
table in the textbook, and write these critical values next to the
corresponding average percentile values. <em>Make sure to specify the
df with your critical t values.</em>

<li>Equal variances and unequal sample sizes: Do the same thing for
the next sampling distribution. Is there much influence on the
critical values from the unequal sample sizes? In particular, has the
Std. Deviation of the sampling distribution been much influenced?

<li>Unequal variances and equal sample sizes: Do the same thing for
the next sampling distribution.  Is there much influence (relative to
the first distribution above, not the second) on the critical values
from the unequal variances? In particular, has the Std. Deviation of
the sampling distribution been much influenced? Discuss how this
relates to the corrected or adjusted df provided in SPSS t-test output
when the variances are unequal.

<li>Unequal variances and unequal sample sizes: Near the bottom of
p. 304 in Aron and Aron, it says "it turns out that in practice the t
test gives pretty accurate results even when there are fairly large
differences in the population variances, particulalrly when there are
equal or near equal numbers of scores in the two samples." How does
the fourth histogram relate to this statement?

</ul>



<p><li> (4 pts.)  p. 315, set II, #2.  Erratum: For Experiment
<em>iii</em>, the Control Group N should be 10, not 40.



<p><li> (4 pts.)
p. 315, set II, #3.

Annotate your by-hand work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (c) or
(d).  Do part (b).  Verify your work in SPSS (include output).



<p><li> (4 pts.)
p. 315, set II, #5.

Annotate your by-hand work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (c) or (d).  Do
part (b).  Verify your work with SPSS (include the output).


<p><li> (4 pts.)
p. 316, set II, #7.

If the phone book does not have a page number as high as the supplied
random number, just skip to the next random number.  You do not need
to do the computations by hand; just use SPSS.  Determine the effect
size and power.

Suppose you are interested in the weights of newborn gerbils.  From
each litter, you measure the weight of one female and one male.  Here
are the results (at right):


<p> (a) Is there a significant difference between the weights of
newborn females and newborn males?  Conduct this test by considering
the female and male samples to be <em>independent</em>. Do this by
hand and verify with SPSS.  What is the effect size and power of this
test?

<p> (b) Is there a significant difference between the weights of
newborn females and newborn males littermates?  Conduct this test by
considering the female and male littermates to be <em>matched
pairs</em>, and compute a difference for each litter. Do this by hand
and verify with SPSS.  What is the effect size and power of this test?

<p> (c) Do you notice any relationship between weights of littermates
that is not captured by the comparisons of means?
