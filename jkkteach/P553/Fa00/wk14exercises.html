<p><strong>Study Guide p. 95, Exercise 3 and Exercise 4.</strong> You
may do these by hand or with SPSS as you wish.  If you use SPSS,
please annotate the printout, so that the grader knows how you are
interpreting the results.

<p><strong>Textbook pp. 557-560, Exercises 1-5.</strong> You must use
SPSS for Exercises 3 and 4 (p. 559), but you may do the others by hand
or with SPSS as you wish.  When you use SPSS, please annotate the
printout, so that the grader knows how you are interpreting the
results.

<p>Do <em>More</em> (below) without using SPSS:

<p><strong>More, Part A:</strong> A researcher wants to know
whether the sex of the first child from a couple is independent of the
sex of the second born child from the same couple.  The researcher
compiles birth records from 100 families and finds the following
results:

<pre>
                1st born
                 M    F
      2nd    M  30   20
      born   F  20   30
</pre>

Can the researcher reject the null hypthesis of independence?


<p> <strong>More, Part B:</strong> The researcher wants to know
whether the proportional birth rates of boys and girls are equal.  She
consulted statistical records of large families and compiled results
from 1000 families with 7 children.  The researcher counted the number
of families with 0 girls, the number with 1 girl, and so on, and found
these results:

<pre>    
       r    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     freq  30  65 195 210 210 195  65  30
</pre>    

The researcher compared this obtained frequency distribution against
the expected <em>binomial</em> distribution.  Can the null hypothesis
be rejected? 

<p> <strong>More, Part C:</strong> The researcher realized that the
data in Part B can be used much more simply to test the same
hypothesis.  Just determine the total number of girls in the sample of
7000 children, and see if it differs significantly from 3500.  Can the
null hypothesis be rejected?

<p> <strong>More, Part D:</strong> Don't the conclusions from Parts
B and C conflict?  How can the apparent difference be resolved?  HINT:
One possibility comes from Part A -- think about the assumptions in
deriving the expected frequency distribution for part B.  What other
possible explanations are there?
