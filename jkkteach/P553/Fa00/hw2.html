<p><table border=1 cellpadding=10> <tr><td> <p><strong>SPSS syntax
windows.</strong> Some of the exercises this week involve the use of
SPSS to generate sampling distributions. Instead of manually rolling
dice ourselves, we tell SPSS to randomly sample from a specified
population. The commands that we use for this purpose are entered into
an SPSS <em>syntax window</em>. To use syntax windows in SPSS, do the
following.  Under menu Edit/Options click the Viewer tab. Then check
the box by "Display commands in the log" (this will show you the SPSS
commands in your output). Click Apply and Okay.


<p>Copy the SPSS syntax files linked below into your own
directory. (Click on the link, and your web browser will probably ask
you what you want to do with the file. Just save it to whatever
directory is appropriate for you. The web browser might instead
display the text of the file. In this case, select/highlight all the
text in the window, click "copy," and then "paste" into your own
text-only editor, such as NotePad in Win95/98/NT. In your text editor,
save the file in your local directory. Or your web browser might know
about .sps file extensions and immediately invoke SPSS from the syntax
file. In this case, save the syntax file from the File menu in SPSS.)

sampling distribution of the mean, from a uniform

<p><li> (3 pts.) <strong>The central limit theorem.</strong> Load the
file <tt>samplemeanuniform.sps</tt> into a syntax window in SPSS. To
do this, click menu File/Open/Syntax, and browse to find the file you
saved in your directory. When the file is open in an SPSS syntax
window, then run the file (click menu Run/All).  <em>In lab section,
be sure you understand what every line of the SPSS program does.</em>
Print the output, and on the output itself write answers to the
following questions: <br>On the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample
Score," why is the histogram roughly flat (uniform)?  <br>On the next
graph, labeled "R1," why are the end bars of the histogram about half
the height of all the interior bars of the histogram?  <br>Compare the
three "Interactive Graphs." For each of the three histograms, how many
samples contributed to the graph? For each histogram, state the size
of the sample. What is the shape of the first histogram, and is it
like the shape of the population it came from? What is the shape of
the third histogram, and is it like the shape of the population it
came from?<br>Suppose that we have a real sample of nine values, and
the mean of the sample is 0.75. Mark this value on the appropriate
histogram. Do you retain or reject the hypothesis that the sample came
from a population that is uniformly distributed over the interval
[0,1]?

<p><li> (2 pts.) <strong>Sampling distribution of <em>z</em>.</strong>
Load the file <tt>samplez.sps</tt> Run the file.  <em>In lab section,
be sure you understand what every line of the SPSS program does.</em>
Print the output, and on the output itself write answers to the
following questions: <br>Why is the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample
Mean" broader than the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample Z-score"?
Theoretically, what should be the standard deviation of the graph
labeled "Histogram of Sample Mean"?  Theoretically, what should be the
standard deviation of the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample Z-score"?
<br>After the "Frequencies" header in the output, there is a table
that reports values of various percentiles in the Z-score
distribution. Mark these percentiles in the corresponding
histograms. Next to the table, annotate these values with the
theoretically correct values.  <br>Suppose we have a real sample of
three values, and the mean of the sample is 4.0. Mark this value in
the histogram of sample means. What is the Z-score of this sample?
Mark the Z-score in the histogram of sample Z-scores. Do you retain or
reject the hypothesis that the sample came from a population that is
normally distributed with mean=0.0 and SD=3.5?



<p><li> (2 pts.)  Suppose we model a population of <em>continuous</em>
values as a <strong>normal</strong> distribution with mean mu and
standard deviation sigma.  Determine the maximal likelihood estimates
of mu and sigma for the following two sets of scores sampled from the
modeled population: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B: 1, 3, 3, 3, 5.


<p><li> (2 pts.) Suppose we model a population of <em>integer</em>
values as a <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.  The shape of a
uniform distribution is rectangular.  An example is the probability
distribution of a fair, six-sided die.  In general, the probability of
a score is zero until the value gets up to <em>min</em>, at which
point the probability rises to a fixed level until the value of the
score gets to <em>max+1</em>, at which point the probability drops to
zero again.  Because the total probability of all possible values must
add to 1.0, the fixed level of probability between <em>min</em> and
<em>max</em> is 1/(<em>max</em>+1-<em>min</em>). For example, in the
case of the fair six-sided die, <em>min</em>=1, <em>max</em>=6, and
the probability of values from 1 to 6 is 1/6.  Consider the following
scores: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B:
1, 3, 3, 3, 5.  <br>If we let <em>min</em>=0 and <em>max</em>=10, what
is the probability of the scores in Set A?  If we let <em>min</em>=2
and <em>max</em>=4, what is the probability of the scores in Set A?
What are the maximal likelihood estimates of <em>min</em> and
<em>max</em> for the scores in Set A?  What are the maximal likelihood
estimates of <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> for the scores in Set B?
<br>(For your personal edification, compare these results with the
previous exercise.)



<p><li> (2 pts.) Suppose someone claims that a certain six-sided die,
(with sides numbered 1 through 6) is biased, such that the probability
of rolling the die and getting the side with value <em>x</em> is
<em>x<sup>2</sup>/91</em>.  Suppose that we roll the die twice and get value
1 both times.  What is the probability of this happening, given the
claim?  Do you disbelieve the claim?  Suppose that an alternative claim
is that the probability of rolling value <em>x</em> is (7-x)/21.  What
is the probability of getting two rolls of 1, given this alternative
claim?  Do you disbelieve the alternative claim?

person who has never had a course in statistics.
