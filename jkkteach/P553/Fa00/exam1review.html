<ul>



<li><strong>Ubi dubium ibi libertas:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>What does that mean?

	<li>How does it relate to statistics?

	</ul>

<li><strong>Measures of central tendency and variability:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know about relative magnitudes of mode, median and mean in
	skewed distributions.

	<li>Know how to compute mode, median and mean.

	<li>Know the <a href="centraltend.html">definitions of mode,
	median and mean in terms of the measures of variability that they
	minimize</a>, and know how to compute those measures of variability.

	<li>Know the definition of 
	<a href="maxlikeest.html">maximal likelihood estimation</a> 
	and its results for normally distributed models.

	</ul>

<li><strong>Sampling distribution of the sample mean:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>What does the sampling distribution of the mean look like for
	different sample sizes and different shapes of population distribution?

	<li>Be able to state (and understand) the Central Limit Theorem?

	<li>What is the expected value, variance, and shape of the
	sampling distribution of the mean?

	</ul>

<li><strong>z-tests:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to conduct a z-test, both 1-tailed and 2-tailed.

	<li>Be able to compute a confidence interval (2-tailed) based
	on a z-test.

	<li>For z-tests, know about effect size, sample
	size, and power.

	</ul>

<li><strong>t-tests (of a single mean):</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to conduct a t-test, both 1-tailed and 2-tailed.

	<li>Be able to compute a confidence interval (2-tailed) based
	on a t-test.

	<li>For t-tests, know about effect size, sample
	size, and power.

	</ul>
