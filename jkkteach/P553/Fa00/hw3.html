<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 211, Set II, #3, parts a, d, f and g only.

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 211, Set II, #5, part b only.


<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 211, Set II, #6, part b only.


<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 250, Set II, #1.

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 250, Set II, #2.

<!--
For each case, briefly describe what political power might be affected
by high statistical power in these experiments, assuming the null
hypothesis is false.  Consider, for example, insurance companies,
moral conservatives, and advertising companies, respectively.
-->

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 250, Set II, #3.

In the table, the uppercase sigma (which denotes a summation sign)
should be a lowercase sigma (which denotes the standard deviation).

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 250, Set II, #4.

Do not answer the very last question, regarding explaining your answer
to a person who has never learned about power.  <br> <em>But do answer
these:</em> What is the power for 40 participants?  What is the
increase in power over the 20-participant experiment?  How much
additional money would the experimenter expect to pay to the subjects
for this increase in power?

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 251, Set II, #5.

Do not answer the very last question, regarding explaining your answer
to a person who has never learned about power.

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 251, Set II, #6.

<p><li> (2 pts.) Suppose you are evaluating a grant proposal.  The
proposer seeks $250,000 to conduct a series of experiments on patients
with a rare kind of brain lesion.  Let's say the proposer will measure
ability to remember lists of words in the experiment.  A very
interesting and provocative theory, described clearly in the proposal,
predicts that the brain-damaged people should actually remember
slightly better than the control group, and so the investigator
proposes an experiment to test this prediction.  A pilot study shows
that among normals, the mean number of words remembered (from a list
of 20) is 12.2, and the standard deviation is 3.1.  (The SD in the
lesion group could be assumed to be bigger, but we'll just assume that
it's the same.)  The investigator explains that a pool of 8 subjects
is already available from a local clinic for the brain-damaged group.
Suppose that you, as a reviewer of the proposal, want a power of .80
in proposed experiments.  <em>What effect size would be required to
generate this power?</em> (Assume a Type I error rate, i.e. alpha, of
.05.) Suppose that the effect size is actually .2 (small, as predicted
by the proposed theory).  <em>What sample size would be needed to
achieve a power of .80?</em> Should you fund the proposal?

<p><li> (2 pts.) Suppose a competing theorist actually runs the
proposed experiment on the 8 brain-damaged patients, and comes up with
a mean number of remembered words of 13.0.  Is the null hypothesis
(that the mean is 12.2) rejected?  The competing theorist says that
the proposed theory's prediction is thereby disconfirmed.  What does
the original theorist argue in response?


<p><li> (3 pts.)  Suppose our null hypothesis is that the population
is uniformly distributed from -0.5 to +0.5, and our alternative
hypothesis is that the population is uniformly distributed from -1.0
to +1.0. Notice that these two hypothesized populations have the same
mean (i.e., zero). We will use the sample <em>standard deviation</em>
to decide whether we can reject the null hypothesis. If our sample
size is N=4, and our alpha level is 5%, what is the approximate power
of the test? (Hint: Use <a href="powersduniform.sps">this SPSS syntax
file</a> and explain your answer.)
