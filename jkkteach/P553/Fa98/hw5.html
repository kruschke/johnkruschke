<p>Include a printout of any Minitab work requested below.

<p>1. (6 pts.)  Exercise 4, Set I, A&A text, p.306.  First, do this
exercise by hand, showing and annotating your work. Assume this is a
one-tailed test.  Then, verify your by-hand calculations with Minitab
(use the command TWOT with the subcommands POOLED and
ALTERNATIVE). Next, calculate an estimated effect size for the
results, and determine the approximate power.

<p>2. (6 pts.) Exercise 3, Set II, A&A text, p.307.  Do the same as
for 1, above: t-test by hand; verify with Minitab; compute effect
size; and determine power.  This is a one-tailed test.

<p>3. (6 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, A&A text, p.307.  Do the same as
for 1, above: t-test by hand; verify with Minitab; compute effect
size; and determine power.  This is a one-tailed test.

<p>4. (7 pts.) Exercise 6, Set II, A&A text, p.307. Do <em>not</em>
use the list of random numbers supplied on p.307; instead, use Minitab
to generate 32 random page numbers as follows: First, from your own
phone book determine how many pages of residential (non-business)
names there are. For example, last year's Bloomington directory had
234 pages.  Then in Minitab type

<pre>
#
# 234 below is the number of pages; change it to your value.
# c3 below is just an arbitrary column.
#
random 32 c3;
uniform 1 234.
round c3 c3
print c3
</pre>

Then look up the names as directed in the problem.  With the resulting
data, do the same as for 1, above: t-test by hand; verify with
Minitab; compute effect size; and determine power.  This is a
<em>two</em>-tailed test.
