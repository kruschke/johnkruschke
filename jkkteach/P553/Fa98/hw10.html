<h2>
P553 Statistics in Psychology
<br>Homework 10: The Binomial Distribution
<br>Due 3 December 1996.
</h2>
</center>

These exercises assume a dichotomous, nominally scaled population,
with the probability of success denoted "p" and the sample size
denoted "N," unless otherwise stated.


<p><strong>1. (4 pts)</strong> Derive (by hand, showing your
computations!) and graph the binomial distribution for p=.6, with N=1,
N=2, and N=5. (Of course, you can check your work with Minitab if you
like.) Calculate the mean and SD of each of each distribution, and
mark it on the graphs.


<p><strong>2. (4 pts total)</strong> Consider a multiple-choice test with 20
questions, each of which has 5 possible answers.

<p><strong>2A. (2 pts)</strong> Suppose a student gets 7 correct.  Can
the hypothesis that the student was randomly guessing be rejected?
State whether you are conducting a directional test.

<p><strong>2B. (2 pts)</strong> Suppose a student gets just 1 correct.
Can the hypothesis of random guessing be rejected?  State whether you
are conducting a directional test.


<p><strong>3. (4 pts total)</strong> Consider a null hypothesis of
p=.5 and an alternative hypothesis of p=.7.

<p><strong>3A. (2 pts)</strong> For N=6, what is the power of the
test?

<p><strong>3B. (2 pts)</strong> If we want a power of at least .8,
what is the minimal N?


<p><strong>4. (4 pts)</strong> Suppose we have a normal population
with mean 0.0 and SD 1.0, from which we draw random, independent
samples of size 25.  If we draw 20 samples, what is the probability of
getting two or more false alarms, i.e., two or more samples with mean
exceeding the critical value?


<p><strong>5. (5 pts total)</strong> 

<p><strong>5A. (2 pts)</strong> A random sample of 100 students has 54
females and 46 males.  Can the null hypothesis, that the student
population has 50% females, be rejected?

<p><strong>5B. (3 pts)</strong> In a random sample of 100 students,
none knew what the Poisson distribution is.  Can the hypothesis, that
1.5% of the student population knows the definition of the Poisson, be
rejected?  What if 5 students in the sample of 100 knew the definition
-- could the hypothesis be rejected?


<p><strong>6. (4 pts - for those who enjoy trivial pursuits)</strong>
What is the probability that at least two people in a room of 25
people have the same birthday? Assume there are 365 possible
birthdays; i.e., the same month and date qualifies as "the same
birthday" regardless of year of birth.  (HINT: Compute 1.0 minus the
probability that all the birthdays are different.)
