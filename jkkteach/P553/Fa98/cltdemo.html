<p>The Central Limit Theorem.
</h2>
</center>

<p>The central limit theorem says that as the sample size gets large,
the probablity distribution of the sample statistic approaches a
normal distribution.  

<p>Consider flipping a coin N times.  We learned in class that as N
gets large, the distribution of the number of successes, r, becomes
normal, with mean Np and standard deviation sqrt(Npq).  Instead of
measuring the number of successes, r, measure the proportion of
successes, r/N.  Then the mean is Np/N = p, and the standard deviation
is sqrt(Npq)/N = sqrt(pq/N).  In particular, notice that the mean
proportion, p, does not change when N changes, but the standard
deviation, sqrt(pq/N), gets smaller as N increases. (This decrease in
standard deviation is really just a case of the law of large numbers.)

<p>The central limit theorem also applies to sample means: As the
sample size increases, the mean of the sample is distributed
approximately normally.  Moreover, the variation of the sample mean
from the true mean tends to decrease.  We will roll dice to observe
the central limit theorem for means.

<p>Roll a die 15 times and record the results in the first column
below.  This is 15 samples with a sample size of 1.  What is the mean
of each sample?  Because there is only one score per sample, the mean
of the sample is simply the value of the single score.  On a separate
piece of paper, make a histogram of these 15 means, using bins of
0.51-1.50, 1.51-2.50, 2.51-3.50, 3.51-4.50, 4.51-5.50, and 5.51-6.50.
You thereby have a (very) rough indication of the sampling
distribution of the mean for a sample size of 1.

<p>Next, increase the sample size to 3.  If we were gluttons for
boredom, we could roll 3 dice another 15 times, but instead, just use
the values you and your neighbors already generated.  So, in the next
three columns of the table, enter the means of the corresponding three
outcomes, along with the means from two of your neighbors. On a
separate piece of paper, make a histogram of these 15 means, using bins
of 0.51-1.50, 1.51-2.50, 2.51-3.50, 3.51-4.50, 4.51-5.50, and
5.51-6.50.  You thereby have a (very) rough indication of the sampling
distribution of the mean for a sample size of 3.

<p>Next, increase the sample size to 5.  If we were gluttons for
boredom, we could roll 5 dice another 15 times, but instead, just use
the values you and your neighbors already generated.  So, in the next
five columns of the table, enter the means of the corresponding five
outcomes, along with the means from four of your neighbors. On a
separate piece of paper, make a histogram of these 15 means, using bins
of 0.51-1.50, 1.51-2.50, 2.51-3.50, 3.51-4.50, 4.51-5.50, and
5.51-6.50.  You thereby have a (very) rough indication of the sampling
distribution of the mean for a sample size of 5.

<p>Does the sampling distribution become more bell shaped as the
sample size increases?

<p>Does the sampling distribution decrease its variance as the sample
size increases?

<p>Compare this with p.186 of your textbook.
