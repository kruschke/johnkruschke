<p><li><strong>Transformation of scores.</strong> Suppose a researcher
measures the time, in minutes, taken to complete a certain statistics
exercise.  The results are as follows: 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5
(i.e., one 1, two 2's, three 3's, etc.).  What are the mean, median,
and modal durations?

<p>Suppose a second researcher measures the same situation, but
instead of recording duration, she records speed of solution, i.e.,
problems solved per minute.  Then the same subjects' data are as
follows: 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.333, 0.333, 0.333, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25,
0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 (i.e., one 1, two 0.5's, three 0.333's, etc.).
What are the mean, median, and modal speeds?

<p>For each individual score, is it the case that (speed) = 1/(duration) ?

<p>Is it the case that (modal speed) = 1/(modal duration) ?

<p>Is it the case that (median speed) = 1/(median duration) ?

<p>Is it the case that (mean speed) = 1/(mean duration) ?

<p>Is the transformation from duration to speed a linear transformation?
