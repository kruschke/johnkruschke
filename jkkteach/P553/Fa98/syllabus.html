<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Despite the official title
(``Advanced Statistics in Psychology''), this course is an
<em>introduction</em> to basic statistics.  We will cover fundamental
concepts of statistical inference.  We will not deeply address issues
in experimental design, nor the analysis of complex designs.  (The
subsequent course in the sequence, P554 taught by Prof. Lindman,
addresses those issues.) For details of what <em>is</em> covered, read
on.

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This course is intended to bring
all the incoming graduate students in Psychology ``up to pace,'' so it
is not intended to ``weed out'' students with relatively weak previous
training in statistics. On the other hand, this course is definitely
<em>not</em> remedial. It moves quickly and emphasizes conceptual
unification, not rote mechanics. You should have previously taken an
undergraduate course in statistics.  A purpose of P553 is to enrich
and solidify your understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of
methods to which you were previously exposed.  As a suggestive
guideline, if you scored less than 600 on your GRE Math exam, you will
need to plan extra study time to keep up in this course.

<p>Students with relatively strong previous training in statistics
should also find this course useful to refresh their knowledge and to
gain a deeper understanding of the basic concepts.  If you are a
Psychology major and have already taken a comparable graduate-level
course, and feel that you are already thoroughly familiar with the
material in P553, please see the instructor to discuss a possible
exemption from the P553 requirement.  Students exempted from P553 are
encouraged to take more advanced statistics courses instead.

<p>Whereas most of the examples discussed in class will come from
psychology, students from other fields are welcome.

<p><a name="goals"></a> <p><strong>Goals of the Course:</strong> There
are two overarching goals for this course.  The first goal is for you
to understand the basic logic of statistical inference, and to
understand how every particular case we encounter, e.g., z-tests,
t-tests, F-tests, chi-square tests, etc., are simply specific cases of
the same general logic.  This general logic goes under the rubric of
``model fitting''.  This model-fitting approach may be new to you, even
though you've previously taken a statistics course.

<!--
<p>The basic logic of statistics is merely what any clear-thinking
person (someone like you) would do. Consider the basic logic of
scientific method: Given a hypothesis about the world, determine one
of its predictions, and then test whether an observation of the world
is consistent with the prediction.  Statistical inference just adds
randomness and probability: Given a hypothesis about probabilistic
tendencies in the world with random variability, determine one of its
predictions --- a prediction about implied probabilistic tendencies
and variability --- and then test whether an observation of the world
is reasonably consistent with the prediction.  The rest is ``merely''
formalizing those hypotheses, predictions, and observations.  Of
course, many brilliant statisticians and mathematicians have spent
their lives inventing, exploring, and refining formalisms that are
particularly useful, but the point is that all the formalisms are just
precise expressions of straight-forward, clear thinking.  Clear
thinking is something all of you can do, therefore proficiency in
statistics is something all of you can achieve.
-->

<p>The second goal is for you to understand that ``Science is a very
human form of knowledge. ... Every judgment in science stands on the
edge of error, and is personal.  Science is a tribute to what we can
know although we are fallible.''  <a href="bronowski.html">(J.
Bronowski, 1973.)</a> The methods of statistics are the means by which
we stake our claims to (scientific) knowledge, and these methods can
be construed as a profound expression of human culture.  Doing
statistics is exercising our intellectual freedom, and statistics is
based on the same premise as free society.

<p><strong>Campus Computers:</strong> We will be making extensive use
of the various campus computers.  

<ul>

<p><li><strong>World Wide Web:</strong> We will use the World Wide Web
for posting announcements, homework assignments, and discussion.  Our
class web page is

<p>(Notice that the "P" in "P553" is upper case.)

<p><li><strong>Computer Accounts:</strong> <em>If you have not already
done so, please activate your computer account and network ID
immediately.</em> For information, consult the web document <a
href="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/achn.html">
http://kb.indiana.edu/data/achn.html</a>.

<p><li><strong>Statistical Software:</strong> We will use the
statistics programs called SPSS and SAS (and possibly also Minitab).
These are described in the <em>Study Guide</em> that accompanies the
textbook. Information about these programs, as implemented at IU, is
available from the IU Statistical Computing Center, at <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/">

</ul>



<p><strong>Required Tools:</strong>

<ul>

<p><li><strong>Calculator.</strong> Your life will be easier
(especially during exams!) if you have a calculator that has basic
statistical operations including mean and variance (standard
deviation). It seems that batteries have plenty of power until the
exams, at which time the batteries tend to go dead.  So you might want
to get a calculator powered or assisted by photo-voltaic cells.  There
are many different brands and models that suffice, for less than $15.

<p><li><strong>Dice.</strong> Please bring 2 standard, six-sided dice
to lab sections.  Dice can be inexpensively purchased at most variety
stores.

</ul>



<p><strong>Laboratory sessions:</strong> You must attend one weekly
``lab'' session.  The lab sessions will usually be devoted to
participatory activities, solving example problems, computer
demonstrations, and addressing questions from students.  There is a
choice of two times, one on Thursday evening, 7:00-9:00, in PY 113,
and one on Friday morning, 8:15-10:15, also in PY 113.  During the
first week of class go to whichever one is more convenient for you,
and then try to stick to that time for the rest of the semester.

<p><strong>Homework and Exams:</strong> There will be weekly homework
assignments that cumulatively count for 40% of your grade.  Homework
assignments will be posted on the Web.  Late homework will be severely
penalized: Each day late, up to three days, reduces the total possible
by 10%, and <em>after three days no points are possible</em> (unless
you have a cogent excuse, in which case you should contact
Prof. Kruschke as soon as possible, preferably the same day, by phone
or e-mail).  There are two reasons for this policy: First, the course
moves quickly and the material is largely cumulative, so the late
penalty acts as an extra incentive to keep up.  Second, the
assistants, who will be grading the homework, must not be given a
flood of late homework papers just before each exam.

<p>You are encouraged to work together on the homework assignments to
the extent that it enhances your learning of the material, but please
write your own answers in your own words.  Most of the homework
exercises will come from the text and guide, which have answers in the
back of the book. You are encouraged to study these answers after you
have attempted the problem yourself.  In your answers that you submit,
please provide explanations and thoroughly show all your computations,
<em>with annotation</em>.  An unannotated succession of computations
will not get full credit, even if it is ``correct.''

<p>There will be two mid-term exams and a final exam, each counting
20% of your grade.  Each exam will heavily emphasize material from the
immediately preceding part of the course, but will also involve
material from earlier parts, so that the exams are partially
cumulative. <em>The exams require you to work individually and
quickly, unlike the homework assignments.</em>

<p>If you know in advance that you must miss an exam, please let
Prof. Kruschke know ahead of time, and it will usually be possible to
take the exam one or two days before the scheduled date.  If you
unexpectedly miss an exam, discuss the absence with Prof. Kruschke as
soon as possible, typically the same or next day, via phone or e-mail
if not in person.

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Grading is ``on a curve,''
so that your grade depends on your performance relative to the central
tendency of the class.  As this is a graduate course, grades typically
range fairly uniformly from A to B-, and only rarely is a C or less
assigned.  It is Psychology Department policy to give incompletes
(``I'' grades) only with a valid medical excuse.

<p><strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes, nor copies
of overhead projector slides, are available.  If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and then please see
Prof. Kruschke or one of the assistants during office hours if you
have questions.

<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> A <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a> is shown on a separate page,</a> accessible from the web.


<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be suggestive,
not absolute. Any and all of the information on this syllabus is
subject to change at any time, including exam dates, grading policies,
office hours, etc. Changes will be announced in class.
