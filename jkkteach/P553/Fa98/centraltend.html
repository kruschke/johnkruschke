<center><h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2> </center>

<p><strong>We want to choose a value M that represents the central
tendency of a distribution.  By "central tendency" we mean the value M
that <em>varies the least</em> from all the scores x in the
distribution.  To determine the value M, we need to formally define
what we mean by variability.  Below are three definitions of
variability, and their corresponding values for central
tendency.</strong>

<td>Value that Minimizes the Variability</td>

<td>M minimizes V when M is the value of a most frequent score.

<p>Proof: Split sum into matches and nonmatches, then obvious.

</td>

<td>M minimizes V when half the scores are larger and half the scores
are smaller.

<p>Proof: By induction, separately for N even and N odd.

<tr> <td>Terminology</td> <td>M is called the <strong>mode</strong>.</td>
<td>M is called the <strong>median</strong>.</td> <td>M is called the
<strong>mean</strong>. The value of the minimized variability is
called the <strong>variance</strong>.</td> </tr>

<tr> 

<td>Problems or Advantages</td> 

<td>Descriptive: Not unique; distributions can
be multi-modal.</td> 

<td>Descriptive: Not unique for even N.
<p>Inferential: Sampling distribution is difficult to generate
analytically.</td> 

<td>Descriptive: Over-emphasizes
outliers. <p>Inferential <em>advantage</em>: Sampling distributions of
means are analytically tractable.</td>

<p><strong>An Example:</strong> Consider the set of values, 1 2 2 3 3
3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5.  (That is, one 1, two 2's, three 3's, four 4's,
and five 5's.)  

<p>The <em>mode</em> is 5.0, and the minimized Formalization #1
variability around that mode is 10.0.

<p>The <em>median</em> is 4.0, and the minimized Formalization #2
variability around that median is 15.0.

<p>The <em>mean</em> is 3.67, and the variance (minimized
Formalization #3 variability) around that mean is 1.55.
