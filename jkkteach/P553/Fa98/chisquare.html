P553 Statistics in Psychology
<br>Computing the Pearson Chi-Square Distribution
<br>for 3 Categories and Small N
</h2>
</center>

<p>Consider a population with three equally probable categories, A, B
and C.  Thus, p(A) = p(B) = p(C) = 0.333.  I will derive the sampling
distribution of Pearson chi-square for various values of sample size,
N.  Recall that the Pearson chi-square is <br> SUM_k
(obs_k-exp_k)^2/exp_k <br>where the SUM is over categories k, obs_k is
the observed frequency of category k, and exp_k is the expected
frequency of category k.

<p><strong>N = 1.</strong>

<br>When N=1, the expected frequencies of A, B and C in the sample are
0.333.  The table below lists the possible samples, their
probabilities, and their chi-square values.

<pre>
  sample  prob   chi-square
  A       0.333  2.0
  B       0.333  2.0
  C       0.333  2.0
</pre>

<em>So, for N=1, the sampling distribution of chi-square is just a
single spike of height 1.0 at the value 2.0.  That is, for a sample
size of 1.0, there is a 100 per cent probability of getting a sample
with chi-square value of 2.0.</em> (Notice that the mean of sampling
distribution is 2.0, the df.)

<p><strong>N = 2.</strong>

<br>When N=2, the expected frequencies of A, B and C in the sample are
each 0.667.  The table below lists the possible samples, their probabilities, and their chi-square values.

<pre>
  sample  prob   chi-square
  AA      0.111  4.0
  AB      0.111  1.0
  AC      0.111  1.0
  BA      0.111  1.0
  BB      0.111  4.0
  BC      0.111  1.0
  CA      0.111  1.0
  CB      0.111  1.0
  CC      0.111  4.0
</pre>

<em>So, for N=2, the sampling distribution of chi-square is two
spikes, one at value 1.0 of height 0.667, the other at value 4.0 of
height 0.333.</em> (Notice that the mean of sampling
distribution is 2.0, the df.)

<p><strong>N = 3.</strong> <br>When N=3, we can list all 27
possibilities analogously to the above tables, but instead let's try
to produce general formulas.  (We will, in essence, be deriving a case
of the <em>multinomial distribution</em>, so you might like to look
this up in a statistics textbook.)

<p>A sample of size N can be construed as N "slots" that need to be
filled with instances from the population.  Suppose we fill r of the
slots with instances of category A, s of the slots with instances of
B, and t of the slots with instances of C.  How many different samples
have r A's, s B's, and t C's?  To answer this question, consider first
that there are (N choose r) ways to place the r A's in the N slots.
Then, in the remaining N-r slots, there are (N-r choose s) ways to
place the s B's.  Finally, there are just N-r-s = t remaining slots,
into which the t C's can be placed (just one way).  So, there are (N
choose r)*(N-r choose s) samples with r A's, S B's, and t C's.

<p>Instead of considering every possible sample of size N (of which
there are 3^N possibilities) as we did for N=1 and N=2, we consider
the possible values of r, s and t (of which there are fewer
possibilities: N,0,0; N-1,1,0; N-1,0,1; N-2,2,0; N-2,1,1; N-2,0,2;
...; 0,1,N-1; 0,0,N) and multiply the probability of each possibility
by (N choose r)*(N-r choose s).

<p>As a final simplification, when the probabilities are all equal in
the population, the chi-square for r,s,t is the same as for s,r,t and
t,r,s, etc., so we need only compute it once, and then just multiply
by the number of distinct permutations of r, s and t.  For example,
the result N,0,0 has three distinct permutations: N,0,0; 0,N,0; and
0,0,N.  The result N,1,0 has six distinct permutations: N,1,0; N,0,1;
1,N,0; 1,0,N; 0,N,1 and 0,1,N.

<p>Thus, for N = 3:

<pre>
sample
distrib.          (N choose r)    # distinct    
r,s,t     prob   *(N-r choose s)  permutations  product  chi-square
--------  -----  ---------------  ------------  -------  ----------
3,0,0     .0370   1               3              3       6.0
2,1,0     .0370   3               6             18       2.0
1,1,1     .0370   6               1              6       0.0
</pre>

The product value simply tells us the number of samples with r A's, s
B's, and t C's.  (Notice that the product column sums to 27, exactly
the number of distinct samples of size 3.)  <em>So, for N=3, the
chi-square sampling distribution has three values, with value 0.0
having a probability of 6*.037=0.222, value 2.0 having a probability
of 18*.037=0.666, and value 6.0 having a probability of 0.111.</em>
(Notice that the mean of sampling distribution is 2.0, the df.)

<p><strong>N greater than 3.</strong> <br>Hopefully you can
extrapolate the method used for N=3 to cases of N=4, N=5, etc.  When N
gets much larger, this method becomes intractable too, and then you
can write a computer program to arrive at an answer.
