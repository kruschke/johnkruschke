<h2>
Exam 2 Sample Questions
</h2>
</center>

<p>The exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged to
use a calculator (and you may also bring along the calculator manual).
There are 100 points possible, with points for each problem as marked.
You have 75 minutes; please allocate your time carefully.

<p><strong>1. (30 pts. total):</strong> 

<p><strong>Part A (15 pts).</strong> Test whether the means of the following
three groups differ. Use a significance level of 5%.
<br>Group 1: 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 <br>Group 2: 13.0, 15.0, 17.0
<br>Group 3: 6.0, 9.0, 12.0 


<p><strong>Part B (5 pts).</strong> What assumptions have you made in
conducting the test?



<p><strong>Part C (5 pts).</strong> What is the proportion of total
variance accounted for by the difference of group means?


<p><strong>Part D (5 pts).</strong> What is the effect size and
approximate power of the test?


<p><strong>2. (25 pts. total):</strong>
 
<p><strong>Part A (15 pts).</strong> Test whether the means of the
following two groups differ.  Use a two-tailed <em>t</em>-test, with
significance level of .05. (Also okay to use an ANOVA.) <br>Group 1:
17.0, 21.0, 24.0 <br>Group 2: 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, 18.0


<p><strong>Part B (5 pts).</strong> What assumptions have you made in
conducting the test?


<p><strong>Part C (5 pts).</strong> What is the effect size and
approximate power of the test? (Use <em>d</em> as a measure of effect
size, not <em>f</em>.)

<p><strong>3. (25 pts. total):</strong>

<p>Suppose we measure ``feeling of contentment'' of students before
and after taking a statistics exam.  Feeling of contentment is rated
on a scale from 1~(low) to 10~(high).  For nine students selected at
random, the before and after ratings are as follows: 3,1; 5,7; 8,8;
4,2; 9,10; 2,3; 8,10; 1,1; 6,5.

<p><strong>Part A (10 pts).</strong> Compute the standardized values
and the correlation coefficient of the before and after scores. (If
using a calculator that computes <em>r</em> from the raw scores,
please also report the standardized scores.)


<p><strong>Part B (5 pts).</strong> Suppose we have a null hypothesis
that feelings of contentment before and after the exam are completely
uncorrelated.  Test this hypothesis, assuming a two-tailed test and a
significance level of .05.


<p><strong>Part C (5 pts).</strong> What assumptions have you made in
conducting the test?


<p><strong>Part D (5 pts).</strong> What is the effect size and
approximate power of the test?


<p><strong>4. (20 pts. total):</strong>

<p>In a Minitab print out of a regression problem, like the one shown
below, you should know 

<ul>

<li>how to compute R-sq from the analysis of variance information

<li>where the DF came from in the analysis of variance

<li>where the MS and F values came from in the analysis of variance

<li>how to determine the group means from the regression equation, and
whether particular pairs of groups means differ significantly.

</ul>
