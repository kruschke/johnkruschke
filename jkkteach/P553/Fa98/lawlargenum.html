<p>The Law of Large Numbers.
</h2>
</center>


<p>The law of large numbers says that the observed proportion in a
sample will tend to more accurately reflect the true proportion in the
population when the the sample size is larger (assuming that the
sample was drawn randomly from the population).

<p>We will roll dice to observe the law of large numbers in action.

<p>Consider a regular, six sided die, with faces numbered 1 to 6.
Half of its faces have odd numbers, and half have even numbers.  Thus,
for a fair, unbiased die, the proportion of ways it can come up odd is
0.5.  We can denote this formally by saying that for the population of
rolls of a fair die, the probability of an odd value outcome is <em>p
= 0.5</em>.

<p>When we actually roll the die any finite number of times, however,
the proportion of times that it comes up odd valued will usually not
be exactly 0.5.  Denote the number of rolls as <em>N</em>, and denote
the proportion of rolls that are odd as <em>P = #odd/N</em>.

<p>The law of large numbers states that the difference between the
true probability <em>p</em> and the sample proportion <em>P</em> tends
to get smaller as the sample size <em>N</em> increases.  Formally, the
law of large numbers says that for any given critical deviation
<em>delta</em> between <em>P</em> and <em>p</em>, the probability that
the sample proportion lies within this deviation goes to 1.0 as the
sample size increases more and more.  The goal of this exercise is to
make this last statement sensible and concrete.

You will roll a die a certain number of times, <em>N</em>, and tally
the number of times it comes up odd or even.  From this tally, compute
the proportion, <em>P</em>, of times it came up odd in your sample
(<em>P = #odd/[#odd+#even] = #odd/N</em>).  Then determine whether this
sample proportion is within an arbitrary critical deviation, <em>delta
= .21.</em>, from the true probability.  Finally, record for how many
people in your lab section this was true.

<p>Did the number of people, for whom |<em>P</em>-.5| was less than
.21, <em>increase</em> as the sample size increased?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Suppose one person rolls the die 2 times, and another person rolls
the die 50 times.  Is the person with the 50-roll sample
<em>guaranteed</em> to have a sample proportion closer to .5 than the
person with the 2-roll sample?  Why not?
