<h2>
P553 Statistics in Psychology<br>
Homework 4: <em>t</em>-test of a single mean.
<br>Due 1 Oct. 1996 
</h2>
</center>

<p>1.(9 pts.) The Minitab commands at the end of this page illustrate
the sampling distribution for the <em>t</em> statistic.  The commands
grab 500 samples from a normal population (mean 0.0 and variance 1.0),
compute the <em>t</em> and <em>z</em> of the sample, and then plot the
sampling distributions of <em>t</em> and <em>z</em>.  This is done for
three different sample sizes (N=2, N=4, and N=50).  Here are questions
to answer:

<ul>

<li>What are the means of the <em>t</em> and <em>z</em> sampling
distributions?  What are the theoretically expected values of the
means?

<li>What are the variances of the <em>t</em> and <em>z</em> sampling
distributions?  Which is greater, the <em>t</em> or <em>z</em>?

<li>What are the approximate critical values in the <em>t</em> and
<em>z</em> sampling distributions for alpha of 5%?  That is, what are
the approximate <em>t</em> and <em>z</em> values for which 5% of the
samples are larger?  Which is larger, the <em>t</em> critical value or
the <em>z</em> critical value?

<li>What are the critical <em>t</em> values listed in the
<em>t</em>-table for sample sizes of 2, 4 and 50? (Careful, N is not
df!)  Are the approximate critical values in your sampling
distribution close to the tabled values?

</ul>

<p>2. (4 pts.) Exercise 2, Set II, p.278 of A&A text. Do this by hand
<em>and</em> with Minitab to check your results (include a printout of
your Minitab session).

<p>3. (4 pts.) Exercise 4, Set II, p.278 of A&A text. Do this by hand
<em>and</em> with Minitab to check your results (include a printout of
your Minitab session).  Note that it asks for the effect size.

<p>4. (4 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.278 of A&A text. Do this by hand
<em>and</em> with Minitab to check your result (include a printout of
your Minitab session)s.

<p>5. (4 pts.) Exercise 7, Set II, p.279 of A&A text.  When
"explaining" be brief and concise. Note that it asks for the
approximate power of the study.

Below are the Minitab commands for demonstrating the sampling
distribution of the <em>t</em> statistic in Exercise 1.  You can (1)
just type them into Minitab line by line, or (2) if you know how, you
can download this page to your Mac or PC, edit away all the text
above, and then execute it in Minitab, or (3) if you use Zinc, you can
copy it from my directory: /N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/t.MTB and
/N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/t_getsample.mtb.

<p>To write the file named 't_getsample.mtb', on Zinc you can use the
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b103/">Pico text editor</a>.

<pre>
# In a separate file named 't_getsample.mtb', 
# include the following six lines:
#
#  random 'N' 'sample';
#  normal 0.0 1.0.
#  let 't'('rowindex') = (mean('sample')-0.0)/(stdev('sample')/sqrt('N'))
#  let 'z'('rowindex') = (mean('sample')-0.0)/(1.0/sqrt('N'))
#  let 'rowindex' = 'rowindex' + 1
#  end
#

#
# Now initialize the sampling variables
#
name c1 'sample'
name c2 't'
name c3 'z'
name k1 'N'
name k2 'rowindex'
#
# Now draw 500 samples of size 2 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample t and z
#
let 'N' = 2
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 't_getsample.mtb' 500
histogram 't' 'z' -3.0 0.5
describe 't' 'z'
#
# Now draw 500 samples of size 4 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample t and z

let 'N' = 4
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 't_getsample.mtb' 500

#
# Now draw 500 samples of size 50 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample t and z
#
let 'N' = 50
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 't_getsample.mtb' 500
histogram 't' 'z' -3.0 0.5
