<p><li>(3 pts.)

Suppose an experiment has three conditions with three subjects each,
with scores as follows:

<center>
<table width=100%>
<tr>
<td align=right>Group A: 1, 2, 3</td>
<td align=center>Group B: 2, 3, 4</td>
<td align=left>Group C: 5, 6, 7</td>
</tr></table>
</center>

Conduct an omnibus ANOVA completely by hand, showing your work.  State
the three main assumptions of the test.  Then verify your computations
with SPSS, including your printout.

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 346, Set II, #2.  Do each part by hand, and check each part with
SPSS.  What is the proportion of variance accounted for by group
membership?  Also compute the effect size and approximate power for
each part.  Notice that all that differs between part (a) and part (b)
is the mean of Group 2, but the <em>range</em> of group means is the
same.  What component(s) of the F statistic is affected by this
change in group mean?



<p><li>(4 pts.)

P.346, Set <strong>I</strong>, #6.  Write down the three lists of
words that you find, and indicate the length of each word.  You can
conduct the analysis in SPSS if you like.


<p><li>(3 pts.)

P. 347, Set II, #4.  Show your work, but do not do part (a). Do part
(b).  Do not do part (c).

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 373, Set II, #2.  Also compute R<sup>2</sup>.  Do by hand, verify
in SPSS.  Annotate how you determine R<sup>2</sup> from your SPSS
print out.

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 373, Set II, #5.  Verify in SPSS, using both ANOVA and
<em>t</em>-test. Annotate the corresponding parts of the ANOVA and
<em>t</em>-test print outs.

<p><li>(3 pts.)

For this exercise you are to draw a diagram of power for one-way
ANOVA, analogous to <a href="power.html">the power diagram for
standardized means</a>.  Suppose that there are three normal
populations with common variance sigma<sub>W</sub>.  Under the null
hypothesis, mu<sub>1</sub> = mu<sub>2</sub> = mu<sub>3</sub>.  Under
the alternative hypothesis, mu<sub>1</sub>+1 = mu<sub>2</sub> =
mu<sub>3</sub>-1.  Draw pictures of the two sets of populations, and
draw pictures of the implied sampling distributions of F.  Indicate
F<sub>crit</sub>, the region that constitutes the Type I error rate,
and, importantly, the region that constitutes the power.  Can you find
a clear way to indicate effect size, <em>f</em> (p. 339) in your
drawing?  Would effect size be drawn on the population side or on the
sampling side?
