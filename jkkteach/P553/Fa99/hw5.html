<p><li> (2 pts.)
p. 285, set II, #1.

<!--
<p><li> (3 pts.)
p. 285, set II, #2.
Assume a two-tailed test.
Annotate your work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a)-(c).
-->

<p><li> (3 pts.)  
p. 285, set II, #3.

Assume a one-tailed test (i.e., was there a significant reduction in
cholesteral level).

Annotate your work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (b) or (d).  Do
part (c).

What is the approximate power of this test?


<p><li> (3 pts.)
p. 286, set II, #4.

Annotate your work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (b) or (d).  Do
part (c).  

What is the approximate power of this test?


<p><li> (3 pts.)
p. 286, set II, #5.

Annotate your work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (b) or (d).  Do
part (c).  

What is the approximate power of this test?


<p><li> (3 pts.)  p. 315, set II, #2.  Erratum: For Experiment
<em>iii</em>, the Control Group N should be 10, not 40.



<p><li> (3 pts.)
p. 315, set II, #3.

Annotate your work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (c) or (d).  Do
part (b).  



<p><li> (3 pts.)
p. 315, set II, #5.

Annotate your work, but do <em>not</em> do parts (a), (c) or (d).  Do
part (b).  


<p><li> (3 pts.)
p. 316, set II, #7.

If the phone book does not have a page number as high as the supplied
random number, just skip to the next random number.

Determine the effect size and power.


<p><li> (2 pts.)

Suppose you are interested in the weights of newborn gerbils.  From each litter, you measure the weight of one female and one male.  Here are the results:

<p><table>

<tr>
<td align=center>Litter</td>
<td align=center>Female</td>
<td align=center>Male</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>A</td>
<td align=center>6</td>
<td align=center>6</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>B</td>
<td align=center>5</td>
<td align=center>7</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>C</td>
<td align=center>4</td>
<td align=center>8</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>D</td>
<td align=center>3</td>
<td align=center>9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>E</td>
<td align=center>2</td>
<td align=center>10</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p> (a) Is there a significant difference between the weights of
newborn females and newborn males?  Conduct this test by considering
the female and male samples to be independent.  What is the effect
size and power of this test?

<p> (b) Is there a significant difference between the weights of
newborn females and newborn males littermates?  Conduct this test by
considering the female and male littermates to be matched pairs, and
compute a difference for each litter.  What is the effect size and
power of this test?
