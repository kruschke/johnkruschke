<p>1. (3 pts.) The Minitab commands listed at the end of this page
illustrate the central limit theorem...  

<p>1. (2 pts.) Exercise 1, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>2. (3 pts.) Exercise 3, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>3. (2 pts.) Exercise 4, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>4. (3 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>5. (2 pts.) Exercise 3, Set II, p.246 of A&A text.
						     
<p>6. (2 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.247 of A&A text.

<p>7. (4 pts.) Exercise 6d and 6e, Set II, p.247 of A&A text.

<p>8. (4 pts.) Consider two population distributions.  We are told
that mu_0 = 100, mu_1 = 95, and sigma = 15 (for both).  What is the
sample size needed for a power of .8 or better?


Here's the solution:<p> Notice that mu_1 is LESS
than mu_0, so you can draw the picture of the sampling distributions
correctly.  Now go through the usual two steps in computering power.
First, from the null hypothesis, <br>

z_crit = -1.65 = ( M_crit - 100 ) / ( 15 / sqrt(N) )<br>

Second, from the alternative hypothesis,<br> 

z for .8 = 0.84 = ( M_crit - 95 ) / ( 15 / sqrt(N) )<br>

That gives two equations with two unknowns. Using the first equation,
we get<br>

M_crit = -1.65 * ( 15 / sqrt(N) ) + 100<br>

Plugging that into the second equation yields<br> 

0.84 = ( [ -1.65 * ( 15 / sqrt(N) ) + 100] - 95 ) / ( 15 / sqrt(N) )<br>

Solving for N yields<br>

N = [ ( 1.65*15 + .84*15 ) / (100-95) ]^2 = 55.8 <br>

So, we need N to be at least 56 for a power at least 0.8.  (If I made
an error anywhere in there, please let me know!  You can check it by
computing the power for N=56.)<p>

Below are the Minitab commands for demonstrating the central limit
theorem in Exercise 1.  You can (1) just type them into Minitab line
by line, or (2) if you know how, you can download this page to your
Mac or PC, edit away all the text above, and then execute it in
Minitab, or (3) if you use Zinc, you can copy it from my directory:
/N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/clt.MTB and
/N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/clt_getsample.mtb

# In a separate file named 'clt_getsample.mtb',
