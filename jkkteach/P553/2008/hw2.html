<p><li> (3 pts.) Suppose someone claims that a certain six-sided die,
(with sides numbered 1 through 6) is biased, such that the probability
of rolling the die and getting the side with value <em>x</em> is
<em>x<sup>2</sup>/91</em>.  Suppose that we roll the die twice and get value
1 both times.  What is the probability of this happening, given the
claim?  Do you disbelieve the claim?  Suppose that an alternative claim
is that the probability of rolling value <em>x</em> is (7-x)/21.  What
is the probability of getting two rolls of 1, given this alternative
claim?  Do you disbelieve the alternative claim?


<p><li> (4 pts.) p. 111, #21.  
 
<br>Do not do the very last part, regarding explaining your answer to a
person who has never had a course in statistics.


<p><li> (4 pts.) p. 145, #18.

<br>Do not do the very last part, regarding explaining your answer to
a person who has never had a course in statistics. (If you want more
practice doing this, try p. 145, #19.)

<p><li> (4 pts.) p. 183, #13, parts a, d, f and g only.

<p><li> (4 pts.) p. 184, #20, parts a and b only.

<br><em>Also answer this: According to the assumed distribution of
"alone dreams" per month in the general population, what percentage of
people have fewer than zero such dreams per month?</em>

(If you want more practice doing this, try p. 184, #19, parts a and b only.)

<table width="40%" align="right" border=1 cellpadding=10> <tr><td>
<strong>SPSS syntax windows.</strong> Some of the exercises this
week involve the use of SPSS to generate sampling
distributions. Instead of manually rolling dice ourselves, we tell
SPSS to randomly sample from a specified population. The commands that
we use for this purpose are entered into an SPSS <em>syntax
window</em>. 
<!-- To use syntax windows in SPSS, do the following.  Under
menu Edit/Options click the Viewer tab. Then check the box by "Display
commands in the log" (this will show you the SPSS commands in your
output). Click Apply and Okay. -->


Save the SPSS syntax files linked below into your own
directory. 
<!-- (Click on the link, and your web browser will probably ask
you what you want to do with the file. Just save it to whatever
directory is appropriate for you. The web browser might instead
display the text of the file. In this case, select/highlight all the
text in the window, click "copy," and then "paste" into your own
text-only editor, such as NotePad in Windows. In your text editor,
save the file in your local directory. Or your web browser might know
about .sps file extensions and immediately invoke SPSS from the syntax
file. In this case, save the syntax file from the File menu in SPSS.) -->


<ul>

<li><a href="samplemeanuniform.sps">SPSS syntax for generating
sampling distribution of the mean, from a uniform
population. (Filename <tt>samplemeanuniform.sps</tt>.)</a>

<li><a href="samplez.sps">SPSS syntax for generating sampling
distribution of <em>z</em>. (Filename <tt>samplez.sps</tt>.)</a>

</ul>
</td></tr></table>


<p><li> (3 pts.) <strong>The central limit theorem.</strong> Load the
file <tt>samplemeanuniform.sps</tt> (see box at right) into a syntax
window in SPSS. If you just double-click the saved file (in Windows) it should open SPSS automatically. If not, open SPSS, and then click menu File/Open/Syntax, and browse to
find the file you saved in your directory. When the file is open in an
SPSS syntax window, run the file (click menu Run/All). 

<!-- <em>Speed
bump:</em> The latest version of SPSS might have troubles running this
program, which previous versions had no trouble with. If SPSS locks up
when trying to run it, first kill SPSS, re-start it, and then in the
syntax window do not Run/All but instead select (i.e., highlight with
the cursor) just a chunk of lines up to and including the first
EXECUTE command. Then Run/Selection. Then select the next chunk of
lines up to and including the next EXECUTE
command. Run/Selection. Repeat until you've gotten through the whole
program. <em>In lab section, be sure you understand what every line of
the SPSS program does.</em> --> Print the output, and on the output itself
write answers to the following questions: 

<br>* On the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample Score," why is the
histogram roughly flat (uniform)?

<!-- <br>On the next graph, labeled "R1," why are the end bars of the
histogram about half the height of all the interior bars of the
histogram?  -->

<br>* Compare the three "Interactive Graphs." For each of the three
histograms, how many samples contributed to the graph? For each
histogram, state the size of the sample, i.e., the number of scores in
each sample.

<br>* What is the shape of the first histogram, and is it like the shape
of the population it came from? What is the shape of the third
histogram, and is it like the shape of the population it came
from?

<br>* Suppose that we have a real sample of nine values, and the mean of
the sample is 0.75. Mark this value on the appropriate histogram. Do
you retain or reject the hypothesis that the sample came from a
population that is uniformly distributed over the interval [0,1]?

<p><li> (3 pts.) <strong>Sampling distribution of <em>z</em>.</strong>
Load the file <tt>samplez.sps</tt> Run the file.
<em>In lab section, be sure you understand
what every line of the SPSS program does.</em> Print the output, and
on the output itself write answers to the following questions: 

<br>* Why is the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample Mean" broader than
the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample Z-score"?  Theoretically, what
should be the standard deviation of the graph labeled "Histogram of
Sample Mean"?  Theoretically, what should be the standard deviation of
the graph labeled "Histogram of Sample Z-score"?  

<br>* After the "Frequencies" header in the output, there is a table
that reports values of various percentiles in the Z-score
distribution. Mark these percentiles in the corresponding
histograms. Next to the table, annotate these values with the
theoretically correct values.  

<br>* Suppose we have a real sample of three values, and the mean of
the sample is 4.0. Mark this value in the histogram of sample
means. What is the Z-score of this sample?  Mark the Z-score in the
histogram of sample Z-scores. Do you retain or reject the hypothesis
that the sample came from a population that is normally distributed
with mean=0.0 and SD=3.5?

<!--
<p><li> (2 pts.)  Suppose we model a population of <em>continuous</em>
values as a <strong>normal</strong> distribution with mean &mu; and
standard deviation &sigma;.  Determine the maximal likelihood estimates
of &mu; and &sigma; for the following two sets of scores sampled from the
modeled population: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B: 1, 3, 3, 3, 5.
-->

<!--
<p><li> (2 pts.) Suppose we model a population of <em>integer</em>
values as a <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.  The shape of a
uniform distribution over discrete values is a bunch of spikes of
equal heights.  An example is the probability distribution of a fair,
six-sided die.  In general, the probability of a score is zero until
the value gets up to <em>min</em>, at which point the probability
rises to a fixed level until the value of the score gets to
<em>max+1</em>, at which point the probability drops to zero again.
Because the total probability of all possible values must add to 1.0,
the fixed level of probability between <em>min</em> and <em>max</em>
is 1/(<em>max</em>+1-<em>min</em>). For example, in the case of the
fair six-sided die, <em>min</em>=1, <em>max</em>=6, and the
probability of values from 1 to 6 is 1/6.  Consider the following
scores: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B:
1, 3, 3, 3, 5.  <br>If we let <em>min</em>=0 and <em>max</em>=10, what
is the probability of the scores in Set A?  If we let <em>min</em>=2
and <em>max</em>=4, what is the probability of the scores in Set A?
What are the maximal likelihood estimates of <em>min</em> and
<em>max</em> for the scores in Set A?  What are the maximal likelihood
estimates of <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> for the scores in Set B?
<br>(For your personal edification, compare these results with the
previous exercise.)
