Be sure to review the <a href="goals.html">instructional goals</a> of
the first five weeks.<p>

<ul>



<li><strong>Ubi dubium ibi libertas:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>What does that mean?

	<li>How does it relate to statistics?

	</ul>

<li><strong>Measures of central tendency and variability:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know about relative magnitudes of mode, median and mean in
	skewed distributions.

	<li>Know how to compute mode, median and mean.

	<li>Know the <a href="centraltend.html">definitions of mode,
	median and mean in terms of the measures of variability that they
	minimize</a>, and know how to compute those measures of variability.

<!--
	<li>Know the definition of 
	<a href="maxlikeest.html">maximal likelihood estimation</a> 
	and its results for normally distributed models.
-->

	</ul>

<li><strong>Distribution of the sample M:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>What does the sampling distribution of the mean look like for
	different sample sizes and different shapes of population distribution?

	<li>Be able to state (and understand) the Central Limit Theorem.

	<li>What is the expected value, variance, and shape of the
	sampling distribution of the mean?

	</ul>

<li><strong>Distribution of the sample z:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know the definition of sample z. That is, know how the
sample mean is standarized within its own sampling distribution.

	<li>Hypothesis testing: Be able to conduct a z-test.

	<li>Power: For z-tests, know about effect size, sample size,
and power.

	<li>Confidence Interval: Be able to define and compute a
confidence interval (2-tailed) based on a z-test.

	</ul>

<li><strong>Distribution of the sample t:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know the definition of t.

	<li>Hypothesis testing: Be able to conduct a t-test.

	<li>Hypothesis testing: Know why your sample data should be
approximately normal if you want to use the usual critical values for
t.

	<li>Power: For t-tests, know about effect size, sample size,
and power.

	<li>Confidence interval: Be able to define and compute a
confidence interval (2-tailed) based on a t-test.

	</ul>

</ul>
