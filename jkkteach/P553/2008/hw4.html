<p>

<ol>

<p><strong><li>(4 pts) t distribution.</strong> Use the linked <a
href="samplezt.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore sampling
distributions of <em>z</em> and <em>t</em>. Please run the file in
SPSS and do the following.
<ul>

<li>I. Next to each of the first five histograms, write a concise
description of what each is a histogram of.

<li>II. Estimated population variance: <br>(A)&nbsp;On each histogram
of the sample variances (i.e., S_V_N and S_V_NMO), circle the
distribution's mean that is printed in the figure
legend. <br>(B)&nbsp;On each histogram of the sample variances (i.e.,
S_V_N and S_V_NMO), mark its mean with a vertical
line. <br>(C)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the point in the SPSS program,
printed at the very beginning of the output, that specifies the
variance of the <em>population</em> distribution. (To see the commands
in the output, be sure you have them displayed in the output. Edit ->
Options -> Viewer tab -> In the "Initial Output State" box, select
item Log and check the box at the bottom that says "Display commands
in the log".) <br>(D)&nbsp;Which form of sample variance, the form
that divides by N or the form that divides by N-1, has expected value
closest to the population variance?  Write your answer next to the
corresponding histogram.

<li>III. Critical values for <em>z</em>: <br>(A)&nbsp;From the
<em>z</em>-tables in the textbook, what are the critical <em>z</em>
values for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and two-tailed? Write
these next to the sampling distributions of <em>z</em> (fourth and
sixth histograms).  <br>(B)&nbsp;Consider the sampling distributions
of <em>z</em> generated by SPSS. According to the percentiles listed
in the table near the beginning of the SPSS printout, what are the
critical <em>z</em> values for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and
two-tailed?  <br>(C)&nbsp;With vertical lines, mark the textbook
critical values and the SPSS-generated critical values on the second
<em>z</em> histogram; i.e., on the sixth, next-to-last histogram.

<li>IV. Critical values for <em>t</em>: <br>(A)&nbsp;From the
<em>t</em>-tables in the textbook, what are the critical <em>t</em>
values for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and two-tailed? <em>What
df do you use and why?</em> Write your answer next to the sampling
distributions of <em>t</em> (i.e., the fifth and seventh histograms).
<br>(B)&nbsp;Consider the sampling distributions of <em>t</em>
generated by SPSS. According to the percentiles listed in the table
near the beginning of the SPSS printout, what are the critical
<em>t</em> values for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and
two-tailed?  <br>(C)&nbsp;With vertical lines, mark the textbook
critical values and the SPSS-generated critical values on the second
<em>t</em> histogram; i.e., on the seventh, last histogram.

</ul>


<p><strong><li>(4 pts) Power of t-test.</strong>

Use the linked <a href="powert.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore
the power of a <em>t</em> test. Please run the file in SPSS and do the
following.

<ul>

<li>I. Critical value of <em>t</em> from null hypothesis:
<br>(A)&nbsp;What is the sample size used in this program? What are
the <em>df</em> in this case?  <br>(B)&nbsp;From the Appendix in the
textbook, report the critical <em>t</em> values for a one-tailed test
with Type-I error rates of 10%, 5% or 1%. Make sure you use the
correct <em>df</em>. <font size="-1">(Note: I'm having you do this for
a one-tailed test, despite the fact that you'll never use a one-tailed
test in real research, only becaue the Monte Carlo results are more
stable for larger percentages; that is, the Monte Carlo percentages
will better match the theoretical values in the
<em>t</em>-table.)</font> <br>(C)&nbsp;On the SPSS printout of
percentiles, circle and annotate the corresponding estimated critical
values for <em>t</em>.  <br>(D)&nbsp;On the second histogram (i.e.,
the graph with x-axis range -3 to 7), mark these correct and
SPSS-estimated critical values, using vertical lines.

<li>II. Power for small effect size.  <br>(A)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the
part of the SPSS program that specifies a population distribution with
a small effect size (d=.2).  <br>(B)&nbsp;Using the SPSS output table,
estimate the percentile, in this alternative hypothesis sampling
distribution, of the 5%-critical value in the null hypothesis sampling
distribution. What, therefore, is the power of this test?
<br>(C)&nbsp;Find the corresponding power listed in Table 7-9, p. 260,
and report it.  <br>(D)&nbsp;On the fourth graph, mark the 5% critical
value with a vertical line, and mark the area of the histogram that
corresponds to the power of the test. (Notice that the <em>t</em>
distribution is not symmetrical.)

<li>III. Power for moderate effect size.  <br>(A)&nbsp;Circle and annotate
the part of the SPSS program that specifies a population distribution
with a moderate effect size (d=.5).  <br>(B)&nbsp;Using the SPSS
output table, estimate the percentile, in this alternative hypothesis
sampling distribution, of the 5%-critical value in the null hypothesis
sampling distribution. What, therefore, is the power of this test?
<br>(C)&nbsp;Find the corresponding power listed in Table 7-9, p. 260,
and report it.  <br>(D)&nbsp;On the sixth graph, mark the 5% critical
value with a vertical line, and mark the area of the histogram that
corresponds to the power of the test. (Notice that the <em>t</em>
distribution is not symmetrical.)

<li>IV. Power for large effect size.  <br>(A)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the
part of the SPSS program that specifies a population distribution with
a large effect size (d=.8).  <br>(B)&nbsp;Using the SPSS output table,
estimate the percentile, in this alternative hypothesis sampling
distribution, of the 5%-critical value in the null hypothesis sampling
distribution. What, therefore, is the power of this test?
<br>(C)&nbsp;Find the corresponding power listed in Table 7-9, p. 260,
and report it.  <br>(D)&nbsp;On the eighth graph, mark the 5% critical
value with a vertical line, and mark the area of the histogram that
corresponds to the power of the test. (Notice that the <em>t</em>
distribution is not symmetrical.)

<strong><li>(5 pts) Why SPSS tells you about the correlation when
you do a paired-samples t-test,</strong>

Consider a group of people who attend a self-help seminar. At the
beginning and end of the seminar the people are asked to provide a
rating of self-confidence, on a scale of 1 to 12. The results from
nine people are shown in the table at right.  Enter these data into
SPSS, and then compute the difference scores for each subject (use
menu Transform/Compute...).

<ul>

<li>A. Do a one-sample t-test on the difference scores. Can we reject the
null hypothesis that the self-help seminar has no effect on mean
self-confidence?

<li>B. Do a paired-samples t-test on the after and before scores. Can we
reject the null hypothesis that the self-help seminar has no effect on
mean self-confidence?

<li>C. The two tests (one-sample and paired-sample) should agree
exactly. Do they?

<li>D. Is there a significant relationship between the before and after
scores? The answer is YES, despite the fact that there is not a
significant difference in the means before and after. What is the
relationship and where is this indicated in the SPSS t-test output?
(Hint: Consider a scatterplot of the before and after scores. What
happens to people who start off with low self-confidence? What happens
to people who start off with high self-confidence? Would you recommend
this seminar to someone who is already feeling pretty good?)

</ul>

<p><strong><li>(4 pts) Confidence intervals in SPSS.</strong>

How did SPSS compute the confidence interval (CI) for the previous
problem? The answer: Recall that for <em>z</em>-scores, the CI is
M-z<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub> to
M+z<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub>. SPSS computes the CI for <em>t</em>
in the analogous way, as M-t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub> to
M+t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub>. Let's verify that this matches the
output provided by SPSS:

<ul>
<li>A. What is M in this case? (The answer is 3.0. Mark and annotate this on
the SPSS printout.)

<li>B. What is SE<sub>M</sub> in this case? (The answer is 1.7078. Mark and
annotate this on the SPSS printout.)

<li>C. What is t<sub>crit</sub> in this case? Look it up (for 8 df, 5%,
two-tailed).

<li>D. Verify that the CI in the SPSS output is
M-t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub> to
M+t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub>. That is, write down these formulas
and show the equivalence with the SPSS confidence interval.
