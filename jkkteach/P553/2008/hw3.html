<p><li> (3 pts.) p. 184 #19, parts a, b and d only.

<p><li> (3 pts.) p. 184 #20, part d only (you did parts a and b last week).

<!--
<p><li> (3 pts.) p. 296 #15.
For each case, briefly describe what political power might be affected
by high statistical power in these experiments, assuming the null
hypothesis is false.  Consider, for example, insurance companies,
moral conservatives, and advertising companies, respectively.

<li> (3 pts.)  The table at right shows examples of planned
experiments (one per row). For each experiment, determine the effect
size and power, and sketch the population and sampling distributions
for the null and alternative hypotheses. In the sketches, indicate the
effect size and power. In every case, assume that the populations are
normally distributed, and assume a two-tailed test at the .05
significance level.

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 232 #18.  Do not answer part c, regarding
explaining your answer to a person who has never learned about power.
<br> <em>But do answer this question:</em> How much money can the
experimenter expect to pay the participants, in total?


<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 231 #15.  Do not answer part c, regarding
explaining your answer to a person who has never learned about power.

<p><li> (2 pts.) p. 232 #17.

<p><li> (4 pts.) Suppose you are evaluating a grant proposal.  The
proposer seeks $250,000 to conduct a series of experiments on patients
with a rare kind of brain lesion.  Let's say the proposer will measure
ability to remember lists of words in the experiment.  A very
interesting and provocative theory, described clearly in the proposal,
predicts that the brain-damaged people should actually remember
slightly better than the control group, and so the investigator
proposes an experiment to test this prediction.  A pilot study shows
that among normals, the mean number of words remembered (from a list
of 20) is 12.2, and the standard deviation is 3.1.  (The SD in the
lesion group could be assumed to be bigger, but we'll just assume that
it's the same.)  The investigator explains that a pool of 8 subjects
is already available from a local clinic for the brain-damaged group.
Suppose that you, as a reviewer of the proposal, want a power of .80
in proposed experiments.  <br>(A) <em>What effect size would be required to
generate this power?</em> (Assume a Type I error rate, i.e. alpha, of
.05.) <br>(B) Suppose that the effect size is actually .2 (small, as predicted
by the proposed theory).  <em>What sample size would be needed to
achieve a power of .80?</em> <br>(C) Should you fund the proposal?

<p><li> (3 pts.) Suppose a competing theorist actually runs the
proposed experiment on the 8 brain-damaged patients, and comes up with
a mean number of remembered words of 13.0.  <br>(A) Is the null
hypothesis (that the mean is 12.2) rejected?  <br>(B) The competing
theorist says that the proposed theory's prediction is thereby
disconfirmed.  What does the original theorist argue in response?


<p><li> (3 pts.)

To motivate this question, consider this scenario: Suppose we have an
actual sample with N=4 and standard deviation of 0.45. Could we reject
the null hypothesis that the underlying population is uniformly
distributed from -0.5 to +0.5? (The answer is yes...) But the question
for you goes beyond that: Suppose our null hypothesis is that the
population is uniformly distributed from -0.5 to +0.5, and our
alternative hypothesis is that the population is uniformly distributed
from -1.0 to +1.0. Notice that these two hypothesized populations have
the same mean (i.e., zero). We use the sample <em>standard
deviation</em> to decide whether we can reject the null hypothesis.
If our sample size is N=4, and our alpha level is 5%, <strong>what is
the approximate power of the test?</strong> (Hint: Use <a
href="powersduniform.sps">this SPSS syntax file</a> and <em>explain your
answer</em>.)
