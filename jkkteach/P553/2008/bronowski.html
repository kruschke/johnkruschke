<strong>

THEMES:
<ul>

<li>Science is "blind": fallible human inference about reality.  <p>

<li>Scientist as artist: theories are inherently incomplete. <br>(But
art is not science!)  <p>

<li>Science is personal: of people, by people, touches people. <p>

<li>Principle of tolerance.  <br>(Does not imply utter relativism,
that anything goes!)  <p>

<li>Potential conflict of intellectual/scientific ideas with political
ideas.  <p>

<li>"... think it possible you may be mistaken."  <p>

</ul>

SUMMARY:<p>

Formal statistical methods are a profound intellectual expression of
the culture of skepticism.  They are a monumental achievement at the
apex of human culture.  <p>

<em>"A whole conception of culture ... the conception that human
knowledge is personal and responsible, an unending adventure at the
edge of uncertainty."</em> (p.367) <p>

<em>"Every judgment in science stands at the edge of error, and is
personal.  Science is a tribute to what we can know although we are
fallible."</em> (p.374)

Bronowski<br>Episode 11: Knowledge or certainty</font></center>

<p>[<em>The irony of the uncertainty principle amidst the rise of
dictators.</em> <br>The following passage was spoken at the University in
G&ouml;ttingen, Germany:]

<p>Yet the Principle of Uncertainty is a bad
name.  In science or outside it, we are not uncertain; our knowledge
is merely confined within a certain tolerance.  We should call it the
Principle of Tolerance.  And I propose that name in two senses.
First, in the engineering sense.  Science has progressed step by step,
the most successful enterprise in the ascent of man, because it has
understood that the exchange of information between man and nature,
and man and man, can only take place with a certain tolerance.  But
second, I also use the word passionately about the real world.  All
knowledge, all information between human beings can only be exchanged
within a play of tolerance.  And that is true whether the exchange is
in science, or in literature, or in religion, or in politics, or even
in any form of thought that aspires to dogma.  It is a major tragedy
of my lifetime and yours that, here in G&ouml;ttingen, scientists were
refining to the most exquisite precision the Principle of Tolerance,
and turning their backs on the fact that all around them tolerance was
crashing to the ground beyond repair.

<p>The Principle of Uncertainty or, in my phrase, the Principle of
Tolerance, fixed once for all the realization that all knowledge is
limited.  It is an irony of history that at the very time when this
was being worked out there should rise, under Hitler in Germany and
other tyrants elsewhere, a counter-conception: a principle of
monstrous certainty.  When the future looks back on the 1930s it will
think of them as a crucial confrontation of culture as I have been
expounding it, the ascent of man, against the throwback to the
despots' belief that they have absolute certainty.

<p>[<em>Science is a human form of knowledge</em>. <br>The following
passage was spoken at Auschwitz:]

<p>It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into
numbers. That is false, tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is
the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz, this is where
people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes
of four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by
arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality,
this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the
knowledge of gods. 

<p>Science is a very human form of knowledge.  We are always at the
brink of the known, we always feel forward for what is to be hoped.
Every judgment in science stands on the edge or error, and is personal.
Science is a tribute to what we can know although we are fallible.  In
the end the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: "I beseech you, in the
bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken."

<p>... We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute
knowledge and power. We have to close the distance between the
push-button order and the human act. We have to touch people.
