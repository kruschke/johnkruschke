P553 Statistics in Psychology, Prof. Kruschke<br>
</h3>
<h2>
Sample Exam 1
<br><strong>Actual Exam Will Differ.</strong>
</h2>
</center>

<p>The exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged to
use a calculator.  There are 100 points possible, with points for each
problem as marked.  Copies of the z, t and power tables will accompany
the exam (please do not write on these tables, as they will be re-used
for future exams).  You have 75 minutes; please allocate your time
carefully.


<ol>

<p><strong><li> (10 pts.):</strong> State the English translation of
<em>Ubi dubium ibi libertas</em>.  Briefly explain how it relates to
statistics, with respect to both <em>dubium</em> and
<em>libertas</em>.

<p><strong><li> (20 pts):</strong> 

<p><strong>(a)</strong> In a distribution skewed to the left, which is
(typically) larger, the median or the mean?  Why?

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Suppose a sample contains the following
seven scores: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4.  What are the mode, median and mean
values?

<p><strong>(c)</strong> State the definitions of mode, median
and mean in terms of the measures of variability that each
minimizes. For the sample in Part (b), above, compute the value of the
minimal variability for each measure of central tendency.

<!--
<p><strong>(d)</strong> Define what is meant by the "maximal
likelihood estimate" of a parameter value.  If we model a population
as a normal distribution with mean mu, what is the maximal likelihood
estimate of mu in terms of the sample scores?
-->

<p><strong><li> (20 pts):</strong>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> For a given population distribution,
what does the sampling distribution of the mean look like when the
sample size is 1?  (describe in words)

<p><strong>(b)</strong> What does the sampling distribution of
the mean look like when the sample size gets very large? (describe
in words)

<p><strong>(c)</strong> Briefly state the Central Limit Theorem
for the distribution of the sample mean.

<p><strong>(d)</strong> Suppose we have a population with mean
mu = 5.3 and standard deviation sigma = 2.0.  If we sample from that
population with sample size N = 4, what is the expected value of the
sample mean?  What is the standard deviation (standard error) of the
sampling distribution of the mean?


<p><strong><li> (25 pts):</strong>

<p>Suppose we have a null hypothesis that mu<sub>0</sub> = 100.0 and
sigma<sub>0</sub> = 15.0, and an alternative (research) hypothesis
that mu<sub>1</sub> = 95.0 (with the same sigma).  We assume that the
populations are normally distributed.

<p><strong>(a)</strong> What is the effect size for these hypotheses?

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Using a Type I error rate of alpha = .05, and
a sample size of N = 9, what is the power of the test?  (Assume a
non-directional, two-tailed test.)

<p><strong>(c)</strong> If we wanted the power to be at least .84,
what minimal sample size would we need?

<p><strong>(d)</strong> We draw a random sample from the world, with N
= 9, and find that the sample mean is 95.  Can we reject the null
hypothesis? (The null hypothesis was stated at the beginning of this
exercise. Assume a non-directional test with alpha = .05.)

<p><strong>(e)</strong> Suppose that for a sample of 9 scores, the
mean is 93.3.  Using the standard deviation assumed by the null
hypothesis, compute the 95% confidence interval for the population
mean. (Assume a non-directional, two-sided confidence interval.)

<strong><li> (25 pts)</strong>

Suppose we measure "feeling of contentment" of students before and
after taking a statistics exam.  Feeling of contentment is rated on a
scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high).  Suppose we have a null hypothesis
that feelings of contentment will not change during the exam.  For
nine students selected at random, the before and after ratings are as
shown in the table at the right.

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Can the null hypothesis be rejected?
(Assume alpha = .05, two-tailed.)

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Determine the 95% confidence interval (using
the method M-t<sub>crit</sub>SE to M+t<sub>crit</sub>SE).

<p><strong>(c)</strong> Estimate the effect size (of the
change in feeling).

<p><strong>(d)</strong> What is the approximate power of the test?
(Estimate from the tables.)
