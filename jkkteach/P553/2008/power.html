<p>Statistical Power and Effect Size
</h2>
</center>

Figure 1 (below) illustrates the concepts of statistical power and
effect size.  The diagram will be explained in detail in lecture.  One
point to be emphasized is that <em>power</em> lives in the
<em>sampling</em> distributions, whereas <em>effect size</em> lives in
the <em>population</em> distributions.

<p>All the basic computations regarding power result from just the two
equations that describe the position of the critical value in the
sampling distributions.  Figure 2 (right) shows the two sampling
distributions with the critical value of the sample mean labeled as
M<sub>crit</sub>.  Recall from Figure 1 that &sigma;<sub>M</sub> =
&sigma;/sqrt(N).

<p>In the null hypothesis sampling distribution, the diagram indicates
that

<table cellpadding=20>
<tr><td align=center>
z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) = 
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>null</sub>&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>M</sub>
</td>
<td align=right>
[Eqn. 1]
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The value of the Type I error rate sets the desired value of z; if we
want the Type I error rate to be .05, then z(M<sub>crit</sub>) = 1.65,
as shown in the diagram.

<p>In the alternative hypothesis sampling distribution, the diagram indicates
that

<table  cellpadding=20>
<tr><td align=center>
z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) = 
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>alt</sub>&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>M</sub>
</td>
<td align=right>
[Eqn. 2]
</td>
</tr>
</table>


From this value of z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>), we can determine
the power, or, if given a desired power, we can determine the needed
value of z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>).

<strong>Determining power:</strong>
If you are given &mu;<sub>null</sub>, &mu;<sub>alt</sub>, &sigma;, alpha
(i.e., the Type I error rate), and N, then you can compute the power
from the two equations.  Start with Equation 1 to determine
M<sub>crit</sub>.  Then use this value in Equation 2 to determine the
resulting power.

<p><blockquote>
<table cellpadding=10 border=1 bgcolor="lavender"><tr><td>
<em>Example.</em>

Suppose &mu;<sub>null</sub>=0, &sigma;=10, &mu;<sub>alt</sub>=5, alpha=.05,
and N=16. What is the power?

<p>Before jumping into the equations, it would help if you entered
these values into a diagram like Figure 2, above.

<p>We start with the null hypothesis to determine
M<sub>crit</sub>. Because we want alpha=.05 one-tailed, we need
z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>)=1.65. It's positive 1.65, instead
of negative 1.65, because &mu;<sub>alt</sub> is greater than
&mu;<sub>null</sub>. Also notice that because &sigma;=10 and N=16,
&sigma;<sub>M</sub> = 10/sqrt(16) = 2.5.  We then plug in the known
numerical values into Equation 1, z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) =
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>null</sub>&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>M</sub>,
which becomes 1.65 =
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;0&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2.5. Solving
for M<sub>crit</sub> yields M<sub>crit</sub> = 2.5*1.65.

<p>We then consider the alternative hypothesis. Using Equation 2, we
plug in the value of M<sub>crit</sub> that we just determined.
z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) =
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>alt</sub>&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>M</sub>
= (&nbsp;2.5*1.65&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2.5 = &minus;0.35. We
convert this z value to a probability value by looking up the
probabilities in a normal table, such as Table A-1, pp.639-641 of Aron
and Aron. There we find that for z=0.35, the percentage from the mean
is 13.68. Because our M<sub>crit</sub> is below the mean (that's why
the z value was negative), the power is 13.68 plus 50, i.e., 63.68.

<strong>Determining sample size:</strong>
If you are given &mu;<sub>null</sub>, &mu;<sub>alt</sub>, &sigma;, alpha
(i.e., the Type I error rate), and the desired power, then you can
compute the needed N from the two equations.  Essentially, you simply
plug in all the given information into the two equations, which yields
two equations with two unknowns; the unknowns are N and
M<sub>crit</sub>.  Solving the two equations yields N.  


<p><blockquote>
<table cellpadding=10 border=1 bgcolor="lavender"><tr><td>
<em>Example.</em>

Suppose &mu;<sub>null</sub>=0, &sigma;=10, &mu;<sub>alt</sub>=5, alpha=.05,
and a desired power of .75. What is the minimal N needed?

<p>Before jumping into the equations, it would help if you entered
these values into a diagram like Figure 2, above. Also, notice the
similarity of this example to the previous example: The means and
standard deviations are the same. We found that for N=16 the power was
.6368; now we want a power of .75, so we know that N will need to be
bigger than 16.

<p>We start with the null hypothesis to describe
M<sub>crit</sub>. Because we want alpha=.05 one-tailed, we need
z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>)=1.65. It's positive 1.65, instead
of negative 1.65, because &mu;<sub>alt</sub> is greater than
&mu;<sub>null</sub>. We hypothesize &sigma;=10 but we don't know N, so all
we can say is &sigma;<sub>M</sub> = 10/sqrt(N).  We then plug in the
other known numerical values into Equation 1,
z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) =
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>null</sub>&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>M</sub>,
which becomes 1.65 =
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;0&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(10/sqrt(N)),
which rearranged becomes 1.65 * 10 / M<sub>crit</sub> = sqrt(N).

<p>We then consider the alternative hypothesis. We want the power to
be .75, which entails that M<sub>crit</sub> lies below
&mu;<sub>alt</sub> such that the area between &mu;<sub>alt</sub> and
M<sub>crit</sub> is .25. From a table of normal probabilities, such as
Table A-1 in Aron and Aron, we find that a z value of &minus;0.68 is needed
to get at least .25. Using Equation 2,
z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) =
(&nbsp;M<sub>crit</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>alt</sub>&nbsp;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>M</sub>,
we get &minus;0.68 = (M<sub>crit</sub>&minus;5)/(10/sqrt(N)).

<p>The previous two paragraphs have just yielded two equations with
two unknowns, namely N and M<sub>crit</sub>. Now we just solve the
equations. The first equation gave us a for&mu;la for sqrt(N), which we
plug into the second equation: &minus;0.68 =
(M<sub>crit</sub>&minus;5)/(10/sqrt(N)) = (M<sub>crit</sub>&minus;5)/(10/[1.65 *
10 / M<sub>crit</sub>]). Rearranging to solve for M<sub>crit</sub>
yields M<sub>crit</sub>=3.54. Now we can plug that into the first
equation, sqrt(N) = 1.65*10/3.54, hence N=21.7. That is, we need N=22
to get a power of at least .75.

<p>Doing this in
the general case yields:

<table width=100% cellpadding=10>
<tr><td align=center>
N = 
[ ( z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) &minus; z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) ) 
/ effect&nbsp;size ]<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>
</td>
<td align=right>
[Eqn. 3]
</td>
</tr>
</table>

For example, if we have a Type I error rate of .05, then
z<sub>null</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) = 1.65.  If we want a power of
0.84, then z<sub>alt</sub>(M<sub>crit</sub>) = &minus;1.00 (notice the
negative sign, because M<sub>crit</sub> is less than
&mu;<sub>alt</sub>).  For a moderate effect size of 0.5, then Equation 3
implies that N = [ ( 1.65 &minus; &minus;1.00 ) / 0.5 ]<sup>2</sup> = 28.09, so we
need N=29 to achieve a power of at least 0.84.
