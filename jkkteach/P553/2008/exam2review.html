Be sure to review the <a href="goals.html#wk6">instructional goals</a> of
weeks 6-10.<p>

<ul>

<li><strong><em>t</em>-tests of two independent means:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to conduct the test (by hand).  Know how to handle
        unequal sample sizes in the two groups.

	<li>Know the assumptions of the test (regarding the critical
	values in the t table).

	<li>Be able to compute effect size and approximate power (using
        a table). Also be able to estimate power from SPSS-generated
        sampling distributions.

	<li>Be able to compute confidence intervals (using the
        approximation described in the textbook and used by SPSS).

	</ul>

<li><strong>One Way ANOVA:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to conduct the test (by hand).  Is ANOVA a one- or
	a two-tailed test?

	<li>Know the assumptions of the test (regarding the critical
	values in the F table).

	<li>Be able to compute effect size, i.e. proportion of
	variance accounted for, and approximate power (using a table). Also
        be able to estimate power from SPSS-generated
        sampling distributions.

	<li>Know the definition and meaning of the Levene test for
	homogeneity of variance.

	</ul>

<li><strong>Bilinear correlation and regression:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to compute correlation and test its significance
	(by hand).

	<li>Know the assumptions of the test (regarding the population
	assumed for generating critical values that map onto t or F).

	<li>Be able to compute effect size and approximate power. Also
        be able to estimate power from SPSS-generated
        sampling distributions.

	<li>Know about proportion of variance accounted for.

	</ul>

<li><strong>General Linear Model:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know that t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression are all
	cases of the general linear model.

	<li>Know the general form of the F statistic.

	<li>In multiple linear regression, know how to interpret the
	computer output, including the regression equation.

	</ul>
