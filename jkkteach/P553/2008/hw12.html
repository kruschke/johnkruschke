Homework 12: Review <br>Due Thursday 18 December 2008 at the final
exam (12:30pm).
</h2>

<p>Do these exercises by hand, except the t-tests, for which you may
use SPSS if you like. On the other hand, you'll need to do t-tests by
hand on the final exam, so it's good to get the practice now!

<p>Because you will not be getting any corrective feedback on this
homework before the exam, you are welcome and invited to discuss it
thoroughly on the web forum. If you like, you can even post candidate
answers and get verification (or not!) from other people.

<p><strong>1. (6 pts)</strong> <br>(A) We flip a coin 5 times and find that it
comes up heads 3 times.  Test the hypothesis that the coin is fair.
What assumptions have you made? <br>(B) Now the coin is flipped 500 times and
comes up heads 300 times.  Test whether the coin is fair.
<br>(C) If we have an alternative hypothesis that the probability of heads
is .6, what are the powers of the tests (for N=5 and N=500)?

<p><strong>2. (6 pts)</strong> Consumers of cake mixes were observed
in rural and urban areas, and the frequencies with which three brands
were purchased are shown below:

<pre>
                Duncan Hines      Pillsbury       Betty Crocker
      urban          250             200             550
      rural          100             150             300
</pre>

Test the hypothesis that the distributions of cake mix purchases for
the urban and rural consumers come from the same underlying
distribution. What assumptions have you made?

<p><strong>3. (7 pts)</strong> A group of 500 (otherwise normal)
adults viewed a recent popular film which explored the
psychopathologies of serial killers (in graphic detail).  After the
film, half the audience was randomly assigned to a debriefing seminar,
and the other half went to a control group situation (the restrooms).
Measurements of blood pressure were taken immediately after the film
and after the post-film treatment.  Here are data from 4 subjects in
each group:

<pre>
     seminar                    control
  before after               before after
   145    136                 117   105
   128    124                 128   108
   110    109                 110   104
   117    115                 145   115
</pre>

(A) Test the hypothesis that the reduction is the same for both groups
(using a <em>t</em>-test).

<br>(B) Are the difference scores approximately normally
distributed?  (I'm looking for the answer "no".)  What ways have we
learned to deal with non-normal distributions?

<br>(C) Apply a square root transformation to the data and test
whether the reduction is the same for both groups. (Careful: The
transformation is applied to the data that go into the t-test; i.e.,
to the difference scores.)

<br>(D) Transform the scores to ranks and conduct a t-test on the rank
scores.

<br>(E) If you were to conduct a randomization test (treating the
data as the entire population and merely permuting the assignment of
groups to scores as done in the textbook), how many differences of
means would you have to compute to determine the full sampling
distribution? (In other words, how many distinct ways are there of
reassigning scores to groups?)

<!--
<p>(1 pt.) For kicks, use the two-group randomization test macro in Minitab
and test whether the reduction is the same for both groups.

<p><strong>4. (3 pts)</strong> The Reverend Bayes knew it's important
to do the right thing, and so he figured out Bayes' theorem to help.
Do the right thing and figure this out: A stranger walks up to you in
the parking lot and says, "Hey, after some mathematical lucubrations,
I came up with this insightful and broadly useful relationship between
conditional probabilities," and proceeds to show you what you know is
Bayes' theorem.  If the probability of a stranger being a minister is
.001, that is, p(M)=.001, and the probability of a stranger coming up
with Bayes' theorem is .00001, that is, p(B)=.00001, and the
probability of coming up Bayes' theorem if you're a minister is .01,
that is, p(B|M)=.01, then what's the probability that the stranger is
a minister?
-->

<!--
<p><strong>4. (5 pts)</strong> State the central limit theorem.  In
what situations have we applied it?
-->

<p><strong>4. (6 pts)</strong> 
<br>(A) Test the null hypothesis that these
four groups are equally probable:

<pre>
            group   A   B   C   D
    observed freq   8   6   4   2
</pre>

Have the conventional rules for good approximation by the continuous
chi-square been satisfied?

<p>(B) Now test the null hypothesis for these results:

<pre>
            group   A   B   C   D
    observed freq  80  60  40  20
</pre>

Which case (N=20 or N=200) gave the chi-square value with higher
significance (i.e., smaller probability that the null hypothesis would
yield a value that large or larger)?

<!--
<p><strong>6. (4 pts)</strong> (Regarding <em>The New
Know-Nothings</em>.) <ul> <li>In what year did Jay Belsky's article
appear in <em>Zero to Three</em>?  <li>Name the tribal religious
leader who said, "We're not afraid of the truth. We already know our
truth." <li>On page 329, at the end of the 2nd paragraph, Morton Hunt
states that Dayton-Hudson's loss of the trial was "an ominous defeat"
from a (well, his) scientific viewpoint.  Why? (Just for your own
thoughts: Would you like to take a personality test as a condition for
employment?  Would free-thinking scientists/professors put up with
such a condition?) <li>After reading pages 332-338, briefly describe
how your own research might be trivialized by misrepresentation, and
how you might rebutt the trivialization.
</ul>
