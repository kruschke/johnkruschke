<h2>
Homework 5. Due 14 October 2008.
</h2>

This homework might use a lot of paper to print all the output. To
save paper, perhaps print two output pages per side of paper <em>if it is
still legible and neat</em>. Please keep your answers in order, and clearly label what you are doing where.

<p><li>(6 pts) t distribution: Use the linked <a
href="samplet2groups.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore sampling
distributions of <em>t</em>. The goal of this exercise is for you to
see how the t distribution is (or is not) affected by unequal
variances or unequal sample sizes.  Please run the file in SPSS, print
the output, and do the following.

<ul>

<li>Find the lines in the SPSS code (displayed in the output) that
compute t with pooled or unpooled variance. Mark these lines and
annotate which line computes which t (pooled or unpooled).


<li><em>Equal variances and equal sample sizes:</em> The first
sampling distribution assumes normal populations of equal means, equal
variances, and equal sample sizes. <em>This is the null hypothesis on
which are based the critical values of t in the table in the appendix
of the textbook.</em> From the "statistics" output table, average the
magnitudes of the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles, and average the magnitudes
of the 5 and 95 percentiles. Write these averages next to the
table. Now look up the corresponding critical values of t in the t
table in the textbook, and write these critical values next to the
corresponding average percentile values. <em>Make sure to specify the
df with your critical t values.</em>

<li><em>Equal variances and unequal sample sizes:</em> Do the same
thing for the next sampling distribution. Is there much influence on
the critical values from the unequal sample sizes? In particular, has
the Std. Deviation of the sampling distribution been much influenced?

<li><em>Unequal variances and equal sample sizes:</em> Do the same
thing for the next sampling distribution. Is there much influence of
the unequal variances on the critical values (relative to the first
"textbook" distribution above, not the second)? In particular, has the
Std. Deviation of the sampling distribution been much influenced?
Discuss how this relates to the corrected or adjusted df provided in
SPSS t-test output when the variances are unequal.

<li><em>Unequal variances and unequal sample sizes:</em> Near the
top of p. 298 in Aron and Aron, it says "it turns out that in
practice the t test gives pretty accurate results even when there are
fairly large differences in the population variances, particulalrly
when there are equal or near equal numbers of scores in the two
samples." How does the fourth histogram relate to this statement?

</ul>

<em>(c)</em>, the Control Group N should be 10, not 40.

Don't bother with parts (a)-(c), instead, do this: Compute the t-test
by hand and annotate your work, then verify in SPSS (include the
printout).

<p><li> (6 pts.) p. 315 #19.  Don't bother with parts (a)-(c),
instead, do this: Compute the t-test by hand and annotate your
work. Then verify in SPSS, and include the printout. Notice that N1
does not equal N2 in this case; are the t values different for pooled
and unpooled variance (mark this on the printout)?


<p><li> (6 pts.) We are interested in knowing whether girls' names
tend to be longer than boys' names, in terms of number of letters.  Go
to the Social Security Administration list of most popular baby names:
<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/" target="new">
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ </a>. Scroll down the page to the
section where you can retrieve a list of the top baby names for a
given year. Choose a year of your choice and get the list of <em>the
top 50 names from the male and female lists.</em> Enter the data into
SPSS and conduct the t-test (include the printout). Hint: To get the
names into SPSS, try the following. First, on the SSA web page, drag
the cursor over the table to highlight all the names. Copy and paste
into a blank text document (e.g., Notepad in Windows). In the text
document, make sure you have properly pasted all the names in three
columns of 50 rows. Save the text document. Then in SPSS use File ->
Read_Text_Data. Once the names are in your SPSS spreadsheet, compute
their lengths using Transform -> Compute and the formula
<tt>namelength = LENGTH(LTRIM(RTRIM(name)))</tt>.  <strong><em>ALSO:
Determine the effect size and power.</em></strong> <i><a

<li> (7 pts.)

Suppose you are interested in the weights of newborn gerbils.  From
each litter, you measure the weight of one female and one male.  Here
are the results (at right):


<p> (a) Is there a significant difference between the mean weights of
newborn females and newborn males?  Conduct this test by considering
the female and male samples to be <em>independent</em>. Do this by
hand and verify with SPSS.  What is the effect size and power of this
test? Finally, is it logically reasonable to suppose that the males
and females within a litter have independent weights?

<p> (b) Is there a significant difference between the weights of
newborn females and newborn males littermates?  Conduct this test by
considering the female and male littermates to be <em>matched
pairs</em>, and compute a difference for each litter. Do this by hand
and verify with SPSS.  What is the effect size and power of this test?

<p> (c) Do you notice any relationship between weights of littermates
that is not captured by the comparisons of means?
