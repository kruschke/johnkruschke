Homework 11: Chi-Square. Due 9 December 2008.
</h2>
</center>

<!--
<p><strong>1. (4 pts)</strong> Compute and graph the discrete Pearson
chi-square distributions for df=2 with N=4 and with N=5.  Also
determine the mean of each distribution.  See a <a
href="chisquare.html">linked page</a> for a discussion of method.
Better yet, study the linked <a href="ExactChiSquare.SPS">SPSS
program</a>. In that program you can modify the hypothesized
probabilities if you want to, although it's not required for this
exercise. You can expand the program for the case of N=5.
-->

<p><strong>1. (6 pts)</strong> Page 579 <strong>#13</strong>.  <br>Do
part (a) by hand, and answer this: Why is the expected distribution in
Part (a) interesting?  <br>Do part (b) in SPSS by manually entering
the data; include a printout. Keep it clear and organized and in order
with the other exercises, please.

<p> <strong>2. (4 pts)</strong> Page 579 <strong>#15</strong>. Just do
the chi-square test and state the conclusion. Do not otherwise do
parts (a)-(c).


<!--
<p> <strong>3. (4 pts)</strong> Aron and Aron text p.540
<strong>#21</strong>. Verify Part (a) in SPSS by manually entering the
data; include a printout.  
-->

<p> <strong>3. (6 pts)</strong> Page 581 <strong>#24</strong>.  Do not
do Part (c).  <br>Note: #24 is interesting because you have to figure
out that the researchers collapsed "Returned Incomplete" with "Not
Returned", and removed "Undeliverable" from N.





<p><strong>4A (2 pts):</strong> A researcher wants to know
whether the sex of the first child from a couple is independent of the
sex of the second-born child from the same couple.  The researcher
compiles birth records from 100 families and finds the following
results:

<pre>
                1st born
                 M    F
      2nd    M  30   20
      born   F  20   30
</pre>

Can the researcher reject the null hypthesis of independence?  Show
your by-hand computations.


<p> <strong>4B (2 pts):</strong> The researcher wants to know
whether the proportional birth rates of boys and girls are equal.  She
consulted statistical records of large families and compiled results
from 1000 families with 7 children.  The researcher counted the number
of families with 0 girls, the number with 1 girl, and so on, and found
these results:

<pre>    
       r    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     freq  42 125 171 162 162 171 125  42
</pre>    

The researcher compared this obtained frequency distribution against
the expected <em>binomial</em> distribution.  Can the null hypothesis
be rejected? 

<p> <strong>4C (2 pts):</strong> The researcher realized that the
data in Part B can be used much more simply to test the same
hypothesis.  Just determine the total number of girls in the sample of
7000 children, and see if it differs significantly from 3500.  Can the
null hypothesis be rejected?

<p> <strong>4D (3 pts):</strong> Don't the conclusions from Parts B
and C conflict?  How can the apparent difference be resolved?  (HINT:
One possibility comes from Part A -- think about the assumptions in
deriving the expected frequency distribution for part B.) Compare the
observed frequency distribution of part B against an expected
frequency distribution generated as follows: Suppose that the
population consists equally of two types of couples (parents).  One
type has 70% girls, and the other type has 30% girls.  In each type,
the sexes of successive children are independent.  Thus, the overall
distribution of sexes is a mixture of two binomial distributions, one
for p=.7 and one for p=.3.  Can this hypothesis be rejected?
