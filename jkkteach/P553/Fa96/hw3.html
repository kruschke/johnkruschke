<!-- IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, INCLUDE THE MINITAB CLT GENERATION EXERCISE  -->
<!-- IN THE PREVIOUS HOMEWORK INSTEAD OF IN THIS HOMEWORK!!!           -->

<p>1. (4 pts.) The Minitab commands listed at the end of this page
illustrate the central limit theorem.  The commands establish a skewed
population distribution, from which we randomly sample.  Minitab grabs
450 samples of size N from the population, computes the mean of each
sample, and makes a histogram of the 450 sample means (i.e., a
sampling distribution).  The commands do this for various sample sizes
(N=1, 2, 5, 10 and 100).  Run the commands in Minitab and include a
printout of your session.  Here are questions to answer: <ul> <li>For
a sample size of 1, what are the <em>expected</em> frequencies for
each value of the sample mean? <li>As the sample size increases, what
happens to the mean of the sampling distribution? <li>As the sample
size increases, what happens to the variance of the sampling
distribution? <li>As the sample size increases, what happens to the
shape of the sampling distribution?  </ul>

<p>2. (2 pts.) Exercise 1, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>3. (3 pts.) Exercise 3, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>4. (2 pts.) Exercise 4, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>5. (3 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.204 of A&A text.
						     
<p>6. (2 pts.) Exercise 3, Set II, p.246 of A&A text.
						     
<p>7. (2 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.247 of A&A text.

<p>8. (4 pts.) Exercise 6d and 6e, Set II, p.247 of A&A text.

<p>9. (3 pts.) Consider two population distributions.  We are told
that mu_0 = 100, mu_1 = 95, and sigma = 15 (for both).  What is the
sample size needed for a power of .8 or better?

Below are the Minitab commands for demonstrating the central limit
theorem in Exercise 1.  You can (1) just type them into Minitab line
by line, or (2) if you know how, you can download this page to your
Mac or PC, edit away all the text above, and then execute it in
Minitab, or (3) if you use Zinc, you can copy it from my directory:
/N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/clt.MTB and
/N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/clt_getsample.mtb

<p>To write the file named 'clt_getsample.mtb', on Zinc you can use
the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b103/">Pico text
editor</a>.

<pre>
# In a separate file named 'clt_getsample.mtb', 
# include the following five lines:
#
#  random 'N' 'sample';
#  discrete 'x' 'p(x)'.
#  let 'x_bar' ( 'rowindex' ) = mean( 'sample' )
#  let 'rowindex' = 'rowindex' + 1
#  end
#
# Now set up the population distribution
#
name c1 'x'
set c1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
end
name c2 'p(x)'
let c2 = 'x' / sum( 'x' )
#
# Print the population distribution
#
print 'x' 'p(x)'
#
# Plot the population distribution
#
plot 'p(x)' 'x';
xstart 1;
xincrement 2.
#
# Compute the expected value, variance, and SD of 'x'
#
let c3 = 'x' * 'p(x)'
let k1 = sum(c3)
name k1 'E[x]'
print 'E[x]'
let c3 = ( 'x' - 'E[x]' )**2 * 'p(x)'
let k2 = sum(c3)
name k2 'var(x)'
print 'var(x)'
let k3 = sqrt( 'var(x)' )
name k3 'sd(x)'
print 'sd(x)'
#
# Now initialize the sampling variables
#
name c3 'sample'
name c4 'x_bar'
name c5 'z(x_bar)'
name k1 'N'
name k2 'rowindex'
#
# Now draw 450 samples of size 1 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample mean
#
let 'N' = 1
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'clt_getsample.mtb' 450
histogram 'x_bar' 1.0 0.33333
describe 'x_bar'
#
# Now draw 450 samples of size 2 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample mean
#
let 'N' = 2
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'clt_getsample.mtb' 450
histogram 'x_bar' 1.0 0.33333

#
# Now draw 450 samples of size 5 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample mean
#
let 'N' = 5
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'clt_getsample.mtb' 450
histogram 'x_bar' 1.0 0.33333

#
# Now draw 450 samples of size 10 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample mean
#
let 'N' = 10
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'clt_getsample.mtb' 450
histogram 'x_bar' 1.0 0.33333

#
# Now draw 450 samples of size 100 and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample mean
#
let 'N' = 100
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'clt_getsample.mtb' 450
