<h2>
Exam 1 Sample Questions
</h2>
</center>

<p>The exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged to
use a calculator.  There are 100 points possible, with points for each
problem as marked.  You have 75 minutes; please allocate your time
carefully.

<p><strong>1. (20 pts. total):</strong> 

<p><strong>(a, 5 pts)</strong> In a distribution skewed to the left,
which is larger, the median or the mean?  Why?

<p><strong>(b, 5 pts)</strong> Suppose a sample contains the following
seven scores: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4.  What are the mode, median and mean
values?

<p><strong>(c, 10 pts)</strong> State the definitions of mode, median
and mean in terms of the measures of variability that each
minimizes. For the sample in Part (b), above, compute the value of the
minimal variability for each measure of central tendency.


<p><strong>2. (20 pts. total):</strong>

<p><strong>(a, 5 pts)</strong> For a given population distribution,
what does the sampling distribution of the mean look like when the
sample size is 1?  (describe in words)

<p><strong>(b, 5 pts)</strong> What does the sampling distribution of
the mean look like when the sample size approaches infinity? (describe
in words)


<p><strong>(c, 5 pts)</strong> Briefly state the Central Limit Theorem
for the sampling distribution of the sample mean.

<p><strong>(d, 5 pts)</strong> Suppose we have a population with mean
mu = 5.3 and standard deviation sigma = 2.0.  If we sample from that
population with sample size N = 4, what is the expected value of the
sample mean?  What is the standard deviation (standard error) of the
sampling distribution of the mean?


<p><strong>3. (35 pts. total):</strong>

<p>Suppose we have a null hypothesis that mu_0 = 100.0 and sigma_0 =
15.0, and an alternative (research) hypothesis that mu_1 = 95.0 (with
the same sigma).  We assume that the populations are normally
distributed.


<p><strong>(a, 5 pts)</strong> What is the effect size for these
hypotheses?



<p><strong>(b, 10 pts)</strong> Using a Type I error rate of alpha =
.05, and a sample size of N = 9, what is the power of the test?
(Assume a directional, one-tailed test.)



<p><strong>(c, 10 pts)</strong> If we wanted the power to be at least
.80, what minimal sample size would we need?


<p><strong>(d, 10 pts)</strong> We draw a random sample from the
world, with N = 9, which has the following scores: 75, 78, 82, 87, 93,
97, 105, 108, 115.  Can we reject the null hypothesis? (Assume a
directional test with alpha = .05.)


<p><strong>4. (25 pts. total):</strong>

<p>Suppose we measure "feeling of contentment" of students before and
after taking a statistics exam.  Feeling of contentment is rated on a
scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high).  Suppose we have a null hypothesis
that feelings of contentment will not change during the exam.  The
alternative hypothesis is that feeling of contentment will change (so
this is a non-directional, two-tailed test).  For nine students
selected at random, the before and after ratings are as follows: 

<pre>
2,1; 5,5; 7,8; 4,1; 9,10; 3,2; 8,10; 1,1; 6,7.
</pre>


<p><strong>(a, 10 pts)</strong> Estimate the effect size (of the
change in feeling).


<p><strong>(b, 10 pts)</strong> Can the null hypothesis be rejected?
(Assume alpha = .05.)


<p><strong>(c, 5 pts)</strong> When conducting small-sample t-tests,
what assumption must you make about the population and <em>why</em>?
