For each of the data sets below, do the following: 

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation with Minitab (use the "correlate"
command).

<li>Test by hand (i.e., convert <em>r</em> to <em>t</em> by hand)
whether the correlation significantly deviates from zero.  (Two-tailed
test, 5% alpha level.)

<li>Determine the approximate power of the test.

<li>Compute the proportion of variance accounted for (just <em>r</em>^2).

<li>Using Minitab, standardize the data (use the command, "let c3 =
[c1-mean(c1)]/{[count(c1)-1]*stdev(c1)/count(c1)}) and make a
scattergram of the standardized scores (use the "plot" command). and
accurately draw by hand the best fitting regression line.

<li>Using Minitab, make a scattergram of the <em>raw</em> scores (use
the "plot" command), and accurately draw by hand the best fitting
regression line.  Derive and state the regression equation in
raw-score form (that is, derive the slope and intercept of the
raw-score regression line from the values of the correlation, means,
and standard deviations.)

<li>Verify your analyses with a linear regression in Minitab (use the
"regress" command). In the Minitab print out, circle and identify
(a) the slope and intercept of the linear regression equation, (b) the
<em>t</em> statistic that corresponds to your by-hand test of the
correlation, and (c) the proportion of variance accounted for.

<li>Compute the predicted raw-scale value of the predicted (or
"criterion") variable when the predictor variable is the value
indicated in the problems below.

</ul>

<p><strong>Data Set 1 (7 pts): From A&A Text p.97, Set II Exercise
3.</strong> (Use the raw scores.)

<p>Age of Painting is the predictor variable, Number of People is the
predicted variable.  When the painting is only 10 years old, what is
the predicted number of people viewing it?

<p><strong>Data Set 2 (9 pts):</strong> Use Minitab to generate 15
random page numbers for your phone book: From your own phone book
determine how many pages of residential (non-business) names there
are. For example, last year's Bloomington directory had 234 pages.
Then in Minitab type

<pre>
#
# 234 below is the number of pages; change it to your value.
# c3 below is just an arbitrary column.
#
random 15 c3;
uniform 1 234.
round c3 c3
print c3
</pre>

From those 15 random pages in the phone book, select the first name
that has full first and last names included, and record the number of
letters in the first name and the number of letters in the last
name. (Report the names in your homework.) 

<p>Number of letters in first name is the predictor variable, number
of letters in last name is the predicted variable.  When the first
name has 8 letters, what is the predicted number of letters in the
last name?  (By the way, did you know that the most common first name
in the world is "Mohammed" and the most common last name is "Smith"?
Or so I've heard.)

<p><strong>Data Set 3 (9 pts):</strong> 

<p>The data below are estimated from a graph in the Bloomington
Herald-Times.  Year is predictor variable, Tax is predicted variable.
What is the predicted tax for 1996?
