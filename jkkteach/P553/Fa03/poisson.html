<center> <h3><a href="p553.html">P553 Statistics in Psychology,
Professor Kruschke</a> </h3> <h2>The Poisson Approximiation to the Binomial Distribution</h2> </center>

<p>When <em>p</em> is extreme, the binomial is skewed (non-normal),
and we approximate it with the discrete Poisson distribution:

<p><center>
pr(<em>x;m</em>) 
= ( exp(-<em>m</em>)  <em>m<sup>x</sup></em> ) / <em>x</em>!
</center>

<br>for integer-valued <em>x</em> and <em>m</em> greater than zero.
For the approximation to the binomial, we set <em>m = N p</em>, and
<em>x</em> corresponds to <em>r</em>.

<br><br>

<p><em>The example discussed in class:</em> Suppose we have an
assembly line for ball bearings.  We hypothesize a defect rate of 1 in
10,000; i.e., p=0.0001.  We sample 25,000 ball bearings and find that
4 are defective.  Can we reject the hypothesis?

<p>Out of N=25,000, we expect on average to find N*p=2.5 defective
ball bearings, according to the hypothesis. In fact we found r=4,
i.e., more than what we expected. Is this so extreme that we would
reject our hypothesis?

<p>In principle, we could use the binomial distribution. We would sum
up the probability of getting r=4 <em>or more extreme</em> and see
whether that is less than 2.5% (for a two-tailed test with 5% Type I
error). The total probability of getting 4 or more is then

<p>but this is intractable because of the huge factorials.

<p>So, instead we use the Poisson approximation to the binomial,
setting m=N*p=2.5.  First, a trick: The probability that r is 4 or
greater is just 1 minus the probability that r is 3 or less. Thus, the
probability that r is 4 or more is

<center>

<p>1 - [ pr(r=0) + pr(r=1) + pr(r=2) + pr(r=3) ]

<p>= 1 - [ 
exp(-2.5)*2.5<sup>0</sup>/0! +
exp(-2.5)*2.5<sup>1</sup>/1! +
exp(-2.5)*2.5<sup>2</sup>/2! +
exp(-2.5)*2.5<sup>3</sup>/3! ]

<p>= 0.2424...

</center>

<p>Thus, the probability of getting an r of 4 or more is about 24%,
which means that we do not reject the hypothesis.
