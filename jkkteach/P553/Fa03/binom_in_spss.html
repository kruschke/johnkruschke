<h2>Using SPSS to generate binomial and Poisson probability distributions.</h2>

<p><strong>See pages 72-75 of the SPSS textbook by Carver and Nash.</strong>

<p>Basic procedure:
<ol>

<li>In the SPSS spreadsheet, enter consecutive values of
<strong>r</strong> from 0 to N, in a column. On the variable view
sheet, name this column "r", set the decimals to zero. 

<li>On the menu bar, click <tt>Transform</tt> then
<tt>Compute</tt>. Set the Target Variable to, say, "bp" (for binomial
probability) and set the Numeric Expression to "PDF.BINOM(r,N,p)"
where "r" is actually the letter "r" (which matches the variable name
of the integers you entered in the previous step), "N" is the
<em>number</em> N (not the letter), and "p" is the probability of
success (not the letter). For example, if you entered digits 0 to 8 in
the previous step, and you wanted the binomial distribution for
probability success of 0.5, you would type "PDF.BINOM(r,8,.5)" in the
Numeric Expression.

<li>You can also get the <em>cumulative</em> binomial distribution in
the exactly analogous way, using CDF.BINOM instead of PDF.BINOM. This
is useful for determining critial values!

<li>The analogous procedure applies to the Poisson distribution. Use
the expressions PDF.POISSON(r,m) and CDF.POISSON(r,m), where "r" is
the letter "r" matching the integer variable name used in the first
step above, and "m" is the numerical value of the mean.
