For your personal edification, do the "self test" in the A&A Study
Guide for Chapter 15, but do not turn it in. <p>

These exercises can be done in SPSS.  Transformations can be conducted
under the "transform" menu, and automatic ranking can also be done
under the "transform" menu.<p>

1. (8 pts) Exercise 4, Set I, p.473, A&A text.
<p>

2. (9 pts) Exercise 4, Set II, p.474, A&A text.
<p>

3. (8 pts) A researcher is studying the effects of two drugs.  Four
rats are randomly assigned to each of two groups, where Group 1 gets
Drug A and Group 2 gets Drug B.  The researcher measures the time it
takes each rat to get through a maze.  Results are as follows: Group 1
times (in minutes): 1.000, 0.500, 0.333, 0.250.  Group 2 times: 0.250,
0.200, 0.167, 0.143.  Conduct a two-tailed t-test on the times. Are
the assumptions of the t-test met?  Now reconsider the dependent
variable.  Instead of measuring time taken, convert it to speed.
Since the net distance travelled was a constant, converting time to
speed is accomplished by computing the reciprocal of time.  Now
conduct a two-tailed t-test on the speeds.  Are the conlusions the
same for the test on time and on speed?  Which test is more
appropriate and why?  Finally, convert the scores to rank values, and
conduct a t-test on the ranks.  How does the conclusion compare with
the previous two tests?
