1. (1 pt.) Netscape.  Find a Web site that is not linked to the P553
page. Print it, and turn in the first page of the print out, and be
sure to indicate the complete URL of the page (in handwriting at the
top, if necessary). <p>

2. (3 pts.) Newsgroup.  Post a REPLY (NOT a NEW posting) to the
welcome note in our newsgroup.  Be sure that your username accompanies
the reply (so we can record the fact that you completed this portion
of the assignment).  In your REPLY, include a quotation relating to
statistics from someone famous.  (The relation to statistics can be
tangential, but it should be clear, too.) <p>

3. (1 pt.) E-mail.  Send an e-mail message to both of our assistant
instructors.  In the Subject line, be sure to say "P553 Homework 1,"
so that they know what the message is for. <p>

4. (5 pts.)  Exercise 1, Problem Set II, page 29, A&A Textbook.  Do
the tables and histograms in SPSS, and turn in your print-out's from
SPSS. Make two copies of the histogram, and on one copy draw a
frequency polygon. For the grouped frequency table, histogram, and
polygon, explain your choice of intervals.  Have SPSS compute the
mean, standard deviation, and variance of the data. Save these data
for subsequent exercises. <p>

5. (5 pts.) For the data from the previous problem, use SPSS to
convert the raw data to z-scores, and explain in your write-up how you
got SPSS to do it.  Plot a histogram of the z-scores, using intervals
analogous to your choice in the previous problem.  Have SPSS compute
the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the standardized
data. <p>

6. (5 pts.) Exercise 1, Problem Set II, page 61, A&A Textbook.  In
your statement of the definitions, include the defining formulas, but
also be sure to state exactly what measure of variability is minimized
by each kind of central tendency.<p>

7. (5 pts.) Exercise 3, Problem Set II, page 61, A&A Textbook.  Be
sure to think about differences in the SD's as well as in the
means.<p>
