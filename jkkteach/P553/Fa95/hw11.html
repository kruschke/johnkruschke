(4 pts) Aron and Aron text p.443, Set II, <strong>#1</strong>.<br>
Why is the expected distribution in Part (a) interesting?
<p>


(1 pt) Aron and Aron text p.443, Set II, <strong>#3</strong>.<br> Do
<em>not</em> bother to "explain your answer to a person who has never
taken a course in statistics."  <p>


(12 pts) Aron and Aron text p.443, Set II, <strong>#4</strong>.<br>  Also
determine the approximate power for each.<br>  Is the influence of the
increasingly large cell greater for the 2x2 tables or for the 3x3
tables? <p>

Additional exercise:<br>
<strong>Part A:</strong> (2 pts)
A researcher wants to know whether the sex of the first child from
a couple is independent of the sex of the second born child from the
same couple.  The researcher compiles birth records from 100 families
and finds the following results:

<pre>
                1st born
                 M    F
      2nd    M  30   20
      born   F  20   30
</pre>

Can the researcher reject the null hypthesis of independence?  <p>

<strong>Part B:</strong> (3 pts) The researcher wants to know whether
the proportional birth rates of boys and girls are equal.  She
consulted statistical records of large families and compiled results
from 1000 families with 7 children.  The researcher counted the number
of families with 0 girls, the number with 1 girl, and so on, and found
these results:

<pre>    
       r    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     freq  30  65 195 210 210 195  65  30
</pre>    

The researcher compared that obtained frequency distribution against
the expected <em>binomial</em> distribution.  Can the null hypothesis
be rejected? <p>
    
<strong>Part C:</strong> (1 pt) The researcher realized that the data
in Part B can be used much more simply to test the same hypothesis.
Just determine the total number of girls in the sample of 7000
children, and see if it differs significantly from 3500.  Can the null
hypothesis be rejected? <p>
    
<strong>Part D:</strong> (2 pts) Don't the conclusions from Parts B
and C conflict?  How can the apparent difference be resolved?  HINT:
One possibility comes from Part A -- think about the assumptions in
deriving the expected frequency distribution for part B.  What other
possible explanations are there? <p>
