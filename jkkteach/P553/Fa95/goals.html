<a name="wk1"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 1: Concepts of descriptive statistics.
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Basic computer facility, including Netscape (World Wide Web),
newsgroup, e-mail, and use of SPSS (for descriptive statistics).

<li>Concepts of descriptive statistics, including the notions of
central tendency and variability, and the various ways to formalize
them.

</ul>


<a name="wk2"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 2: Hypothesis testing.
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the logic of hypothesis testing, including ideas of
population and sampling distributions, and research vs. null hypothesis.

<li>Understand three reasons why the normal distribution is important,
especially the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).  Gain facility using the
standardized normal.

</ul>


<a name="wk3"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 3: The <em>z</em>-test.
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the distribution of the sample mean, and the expected
mean, variance, and shape of this sampling distribution.  Know how
(and when) to use it in hypothesis testing: When the population
hypothesis assumes values for the mean and variance, and assumes the
population is normal or else there is a large sample size (and when
sampling is random and independent, of course), know how to convert
the sampling distribution of the sample mean to the sampling
distribution of the sample z-score.

<li>Understand Type I and Type II errors, power, effect size and
minimal meaningful difference, and the rationale for certain critical
values or error probabilities.  Be able to compute power and effect
size (when the population hypothesis includes both mean and variance
and when the population is assumed to be normal or the sample size is
large).

</ul>

<a name="wk4"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 4: The <em>t</em>-test.
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the difference in population hypotheses between z-tests
and t-tests. Understand how the t statistic is analogous to the z
statistic, using estimated sigma instead of hypothesized sigma.
Understand how the shape of the sampling distribution of t compares
with the sampling distribution of z.

<li>Understand how the best estimate of the population variance is
slightly larger than the sample variance (i.e., higher than the sample
mean-squared-deviation).

<li>Be able to conduct t-tests for single sample means and for
matched-sample means.

<li>Be able to compute power and effect size for these t-tests.

</ul>

<dt><strong>Week 5: Review
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li><strong><a href="exam1.html">Review for Exam 1.</a></strong>
<strong><a href="dtreemeans.gif">Decision tree</a></strong> for tests
considered so far.

<a name="wk6"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 6: <em>t</em>-tests of independent means
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the sampling distribution for the independent means
t-test.

<li>Understand the assumptions of independence and of equal variances,
and their implications for computing the variance of the difference of
means (S_DIF).  Understand how to construct a t-statistic for the
samples.

<li>Understand that SPSS conducts a test for equal variances, and
understand how to interpret the output of SPSS t-tests.

<li>Be able to computer effect size and approximate power for
independent sample t-tests.

</ul>

<a name="wk7"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 7: One-way ANOVA
</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the meanings of the numerator and denominator of the
F-ratio in one-way ANOVA. Understand the "structural model" approach
to ANOVA and how to compute the F-ratio in this approach. Understand
how a hypothesis about <em>means</em> is tested via a ratio of
<em>variances</em>.

<li>Understand the sampling distribution of the F-ratio, and how it
depends on degrees of freedom.  Understand how to use the table of
critical F values.

<li>Understand how to use SPSS to conduct an ANOVA.

<li>Understand the notion of multiple comparisons (although we won't
have time to do any --- next semester in P554 there will a lot of
practice with this).

<li>Be able to compute estimated effect size and approximate power for
one-way ANOVA. Understand and be able to compute the proportion of
variance accounted for.

</ul>


<a name="wk8"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 8: Bivariate correlation and regression</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the definition of (Pearson) correlation as a
descriptive statistic 

<li>Be able to
<ul>
<li>compute the correlation.
<li>test whether the correlation significantly deviates
from zero.
<li>determine the approximate power of the test.
<li>compute the proportion of variance accounted for.
<li>make a scattergram of the <em>raw</em> scores, and accurately draw
the best fitting regression line.
<li>make a scattergram of the <em>standardized</em> scores, and
accurately draw the best fitting regression line.
<li>compute the predicted raw-scale value of the predicted (or
"criterion") variable when the predictor variable is the value
indicated.
</ul>

<li>Understand the meaning of <em>best linear prediction</em>, and how
the correlation coefficient is the slope of the best fitting line
through the standardized scores.

<li>Understand how the squared correlation is the proportion of
variance accounted for, and how that implies that -1 < r < +1.

</ul>

<a name="wk9"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 9: The General Linear Model</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand how bivariate regression, ANOVA, and t-tests are all
special cases of multiple regression, depending on the number and type
of predictor variable(s).

<li>Understand the F-ratio in the general linear model, and how the
tests in ANOVA, bivariate correlation, and t-tests are special cases
of the general F.
