<p>The workshop shows you how to do Bayesian data analysis, hands on, with free software called R and JAGS.
<!-- The software is free; <b>see installation instructions, <a
href="#beforeArriving">below</a>, <em>before</em> arriving at the
tutorial</b>. -->
The intended audience is grad students, faculty, and other researchers from across the University of Wisconsin at Madison area, who want a ground-floor introduction to Bayesian data analysis. No  mathematical expertise is presumed.
<!-- If you can handle a few minutes of summation notation like
&Sigma;<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub> and integral notation like
&int;&nbsp;x&nbsp;dx, you're good to go. Complete computer programs
will be worked through, step by step. -->
Bayesian analysis provides rich information about the relative credibilities of all candidate parameter values. Bayesian analysis applies seamlessly to small samples, large samples, unbalanced designs, missing data, outliers, etc. Bayesian analysis software is flexible and can be used for a wide variety of data-analytic models. More info about why to go Bayesian is linked below.


<p><b>Agenda:</b> 
<li>Day 1 (Wed. July 11): Bayesian reasoning generally. Bayes' rule, grid approximation, and R. Example: Estimating the bias of a coin. Markov Chain Monte Carlo and JAGS. Example: Estimating parameters of a normal distribution. HDI, ROPE, decision rules, and null values. Robust Bayesian estimation of differences between two groups.
<li>Day 2 (Thu. July 12): The t test and null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The perfidy of p values and the con game of confidence intervals. Sequential testing in NHST and Bayes. The generalized linear model. Simple linear regression. Exponential regression. Multiple linear regression. Logistic regression. Ordinal regression.
<li>Day 3 (Fri. July 13): Hierarchical models: Estimates of means at individual and group levels. Shrinkage. Examples with beta distributions: therapeutic touch, meta-analysis of ESP. Bayesian hierarchical one way ANOVA. Multiple comparisons and shrinkage. Example with unequal variances. How to report a Bayesian analysis.
<li>As time permits: Model comparison as hierarchical modeling. The Bayes factor. Doing it in JAGS. Two Bayesian ways to assess null values; estimation is better than model comparison.


<p>Each day's schedule will include the following sessions: 9:00-10:20 presentation, 10:20-10:40 break, 10:40-12:00 presentation, 12:00-1:30 lunch on your own, 1:30-2:50 presentation, 2:50-3:10 break, 3:10-4:30 presentation. Exact time for each topic may flex in response to audience interest and interactive computer discussion.

<!-- <li> Quick review of <b>the perils of <i>p</i> values</b> discussed in the Introductory Talk. (More reasons to go Bayesian are linked <a href="#whyGoBayesian">below</a>. See also Figure 1.) -->

<!--
<li> <b>Bayes' rule, grid approximation, and R.</b>
<li> <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo and JAGS.</b> This does not involve any physical restraints. Unfortunately, it also does not involve Monte Carlo.
-->
<!-- <li> <b>Coffee break!</b> Everything tastes better when it's Bayesian. -->
<!--
<li> <b>Bayesian comparison of means and hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA with multiple comparisons.</b> Bayesian analysis provides complete distributional information about parameter values and avoids fatal flaws in null hypothesis significance testing.
<li> <b>Bayesian linear regression and logistic regression. Hierarchical models.</b>
<li> <b>Bayesian methods for assessing null values and testing null hypotheses.</b>
-->

<small><b>Bayesian data analysis is not Bayesian modeling of
cognition.</b> Data analysis involves "generic" descriptive models
(such as linear regression) without any necessary interpretation as
cognitive computation. <i>The rational way to estimate parameters in
descriptive models is Bayesian, regardless of whether or not Bayesian
models of mind are viable.</i> The concepts and methods of Bayesian data
analysis transfer to other Bayesian models, including Bayesian models
of cognition. Read more at <a href="http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2011/10/bayesian-models-of-mind-psychometric.html" target="_blank">this blog entry</a>.
