<P>I, too, am having trouble figuring the power for N=500 in question 1. Is anyone feeling kind enough to post the actual computation (with brief explanation)? Please! :)
<P>&gt; I am somewhat puzzled with
<BR>&gt; making the correction of continuity
<BR>&gt; for this question.
<P>&gt; For N=500, I thought I needed
<BR>&gt; to make this correction. However,
<BR>&gt; what puzzles me is if I need to
<BR>&gt; make this correction for both a
<BR>&gt; & b, or just for b, when a
<BR>&gt; & b are:
<P>&gt; a) calculating the Mcrit
<P>&gt; (1.96 = Mcrit - 250/sd)
<P>&gt; b) calculating the Z-score
<BR>&gt;
<P>&gt; (Z = r-M/sd)
<P>&gt; ...or, should I do not make
<BR>&gt; any corrections to a and b?
