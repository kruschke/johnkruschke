<P>Hi - I just want to make sure I am reading the homework instructions correctly. Problems #3 & 4 refer to the problem we did in question #2(both by hand and with SPSS). Should we only be concerned with doing the (i), (ii), (iii) ,etc in problems 18 and 19 (in the book).
<P>Sorry if this is pretty obvious - but it seems a little less rigorous than usual.
<P>charlie
