<P>here's my answers compared to the answers you had:
<P>&gt; Homework #1C -
<BR>&gt; Z Score is 4.43 and power when N= 500 is 96.64%, a little different from yours
<P>&gt; Homework #2 – Yes this is a chi square of independence
<P>&gt; Homework #3A t-score of -2.36 (this is different from your answer)
<BR>&gt; was not severe enough to reject
<BR>&gt; the null considering that tcrit=-2.447
<BR>&gt; (df=6)
<P>&gt; Homework #3D – Data Transformation
<BR>&gt; via the square root does result
<BR>&gt; in rejecting the null and having
<BR>&gt; a significant reduction of BP.
<BR>&gt; My t score = -2.559. Is that close?
<P>&gt; I got a t score = -2.69, kind of close
<P>&gt; Homework #3E Rank order transformation
<BR>&gt; also produced a significant result.
<P>&gt; yeah
<P>&gt; Sample Final 1. Best Transformation:
<BR>&gt; ln(x). This results in a not significant
<BR>&gt; finding (t=-1.54; tcrit=2.447)
<P>this is close to what I got, t=-1.52
<P>&gt; 1B. Data Transformation using
<BR>&gt; Ranks: Also results in a not significant
<BR>&gt; finding (t= -1.583)
<P>yes that is what I got
<P>&gt; 2B. Would the power be 14%
<P>I think it would be 13.3%, close to 14
<P>&gt; 2C Z score of 3.8, thereby
<BR>&gt; resulting in ‘unfair’ ruling,
<P>I got 3.74, so yes, it is unfair
<P>&gt; 3A One can reject the null
<BR>&gt; (assuming the question isn’t asking
<BR>&gt; that the “3” makes the chi square
<BR>&gt; table invalid); df=5, 11.071; Chi
<BR>&gt; square=13.54
<P>right on.
<P>&gt; thanks for any insights or
<BR>&gt; corrections
