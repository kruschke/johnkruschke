<P>I think the two mathods should get the same result. I guess here what confused you is that in Prof. Kruschke's mathod, t is not equal to (M-mu)/sigma, but (M-mu)/(sigma/sqrtN). The estimated sigma, as stated by Prof. Kruschke, is equal to sqrt(ss/df), so, t=(M-mu)/sqrt(ss/df/N), which is exactly the same method stated in the book.
<P>
