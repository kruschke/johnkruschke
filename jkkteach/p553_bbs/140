<P>
<P>&gt; If you would like to test
<BR>&gt; whether obtained distribution of
<BR>&gt; scores is normal you might use
<BR>&gt; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
<BR>&gt; test is based on the largest absolute
<BR>&gt; difference between the observed
<BR>&gt; and the expected cumulative distributions.
<BR>&gt;
<P>&gt; To use it go to: Analyze/NonParamtericTest/1-Sample-K-S
<BR>&gt;
<P>&gt; There, choose your variable
<BR>&gt; and check normal box. If K-S score
<BR>&gt; is not significant (bottom of output)
<BR>&gt; then the distribution is highly
<BR>&gt; likely normal!
<P>&gt; You could try it and test
<BR>&gt; your data in HMW#9 (optional but
<BR>&gt; highly suggested).
