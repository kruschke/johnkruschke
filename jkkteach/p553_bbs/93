<P>Some students asked what values of skewness and kurosis would indicated significant departure from normality. Here is the suggestion:
<P>Skewness A measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric, and has a skewness value of zero. A distribution with a significant positive skewness has a long right tail. A distribution with a significant negative skewness has a long left tail. As a rough guide, a skewness value more than twice it's standard error is taken to indicate a departure from symmetry.
<P>Standard Error of Kurtosis The ratio of kurtosis to its standard error can be used as a test of normality (that is, you can reject normality if the ratio is less than -2 or greater than +2). A large positive value for kurtosis indicates that the tails of the distribution are longer than those of a normal distribution; a negative value for kurtosis indicates shorter tails (becoming like those of a box-shaped uniform distribution).
<P>You are welcomed to use this logic to infere whether your homework statistics (skew.and kurt.) inidicates departure from normality.
