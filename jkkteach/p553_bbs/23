<P>I have a question about #6, about how much additional money would the experimenter expect to pay subjects for the increase in power. Do we need to figure expected value to figure the amount of money? I am not sure what formula to use... and I think I should probably not rely on what common sense is telling me. any suggestions? thanks.
