<P>Prof. Kruschke, On question 4a in the sample test with answers, estimated sigma is defined as = sqrt(SS/df). Estimated sigma is then used to determine the t score. The book however teaches us that to figure the "t score" we use sqrt(S^2m) which is defined as sqrt(S^2/N) and S^2 is equal to SS/df (see page 310) There is a noticable difference in results. Will our answer be wrong if we use the book method? In the book's defense, I think they present the material in a logical and methodical manner and it is the way I come to understand how to do 't scores' Any thoughts would be appreciated. signed, slightly confused.
