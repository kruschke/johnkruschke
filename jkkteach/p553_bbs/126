<P>Remember, the main premise of statistics: "I doubt it!" And you should doubt the answer I gave in the previous posting. I do.
<P>The critical value in the normal approximation is 272.41, but we can only obtain an integer value of r in a sample. So the <em>actual</em> critical value is 273. Then, to compute power, we want to know the sum of the binomial probabilities from 273 up to 500 in the alternative sampling distribution. This is approximated by z(r_crit) = ((273-.5)-(500*.6))/sqrt(500*.6*.4) = -2.51. This corresponds to a power of 99.4%
<P>&gt; Part C has two sub-parts,
<BR>&gt; corresponding to N=5 (Part A) and
<BR>&gt; N=500 (Part B). Here I'll address
<BR>&gt; the latter, i.e., N=500. The null
<BR>&gt; hypothesis is p=.5, and the alternative
<BR>&gt; hypothesis is p=.6. In the null
<BR>&gt; hypothesis sampling distribution,
<BR>&gt; for a 2-tailed test, the critical
<BR>&gt; value of r satisfies z_crit = 1.96
<BR>&gt; = ((r_crit-0.5)-Np)/sqrt(Npq) =
<BR>&gt; ((r_crit-0.5)-250)/11.18. Solving
<BR>&gt; yields r_crit = 272.41. In the
<BR>&gt; alternative hypothesis sampling
<BR>&gt; distribution, z(r_crit) = > (272.41-(500*.6))/sqrt(500*.6*.4)
<BR>&gt; = -2.52. Notice that there was
<BR>&gt; no "correction for continuity"
<BR>&gt; used in standardizing the critical
<BR>&gt; value in the alternative distribution,
<BR>&gt; because the r_crit is already a
<BR>&gt; continuous value obtained not from
<BR>&gt; the binomial but from the normal
<BR>&gt; approximation to the binomial.
<BR>&gt; The value -2.52 corresponds to
<BR>&gt; a huge power of 99.4%
