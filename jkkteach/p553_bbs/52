<P>Thank you so much. You absolutely are correct.
<P>&gt; I think the two mathods should
<BR>&gt; get the same result. I guess here
<BR>&gt; what confused you is that in Prof.
<BR>&gt; Kruschke's mathod, t is not equal
<BR>&gt; to (M-mu)/sigma, but (M-mu)/(sigma/sqrtN).
<BR>&gt; The estimated sigma, as stated
<BR>&gt; by Prof. Kruschke, is equal to
<BR>&gt; sqrt(ss/df), so, t=(M-mu)/sqrt(ss/df/N),
<BR>&gt; which is exactly the same method
<BR>&gt; stated in the book.
<P>&gt;
