<P>This was the only question on the exam for which there wasn't an <em>explicit</em> corresponding question on the practice exam, but certainly it was <em>implicit</em> in doing any sort of resampling test. All I was looking for was a graph with ten spikes (one for each of the ten scores in the data set). The ten spikes should be located on the x-axis at the ten data values, The height of each spike should be 1/10, i.e., each score has a 1/10 probability in the population.
<P>&gt; Maybe I am a knucklehead,
<BR>&gt; but I really couldnt figure out
<BR>&gt; the graph for Question 1C (I did
<BR>&gt; get the number of discrete possibilities
<BR>&gt; however). Was it the same idea
<BR>&gt; as question 1, Homework 11. If
<BR>&gt; there are no make-ups or late final
<BR>&gt; exams that need to be completed,
<BR>&gt; I would greatly appreciate a brief
<BR>&gt; discussion of what you were looking
<BR>&gt; for. Thanks.
