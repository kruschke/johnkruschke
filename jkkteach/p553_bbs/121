<P>hey people, for anyone wondering--my power was a little of for N=500 in HW question #1C. After redoing it, I actually got 99.53%, close to 100%. sorry for any confusion! perhaps i should retire from statistics and return to my true calling, saving the universe...
<P>&gt; Thanks Princess Leah for all
<BR>&gt; of you insights. One question though.
<BR>&gt; Isnt that light saber uncomfortable
<BR>&gt; sitting at a desk using a calculator?
<BR>&gt; I guess you could put on the desk,
<BR>&gt; but wouldnt it fall off and get
<BR>&gt; lost when Han Solo pulled an 8G
<BR>&gt; turn. And finally what are you
<BR>&gt; doing in our statistics class?
<BR>&gt; You must have changed your hairstyle.
<BR>&gt; I havent seen anybody with the
<BR>&gt; hair donuts on their ears and long
<BR>&gt; dresses. Good luck zapping bad
<BR>&gt; guys!
<P>&gt; thanks again, a loyal subject
<BR>&gt; from the republic
