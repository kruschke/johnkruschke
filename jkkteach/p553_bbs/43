<P>
<P>&gt; Are we going to be provided
<BR>&gt; formulas for the test or should
<BR>&gt; we memorize them?
<P>You need to memorize them. There are not that many. (E.g., S^2, t, z, effect size, and only a few others.) Don't just memorize the sequence of symbols - that's a sure way to make errors. Instead, remember the meanings of the components of the formulas: Where did each part of the formula come from? Why is the formula that way?
