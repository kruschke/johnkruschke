<P>Yes, exactly!
<P>&gt; So, for the problem in HW#2,
<BR>&gt; the correct reason to reject the
<BR>&gt; null hypothesis is not just because
<BR>&gt; the possibility of this outcome
<BR>&gt; is below 0.05, but because the
<BR>&gt; possibility of getting this outcome
<BR>&gt; or something more extreme than
<BR>&gt; what we expect is less than .05.
<BR>&gt; Or, in other word, the possibility
<BR>&gt; of getting this outcome is located
<BR>&gt; beyound 95% CI, or located in the
<BR>&gt; 5% 'unconfidential interval'. What's
<BR>&gt; more, I think, for this problem,
<BR>&gt; solving the cutoff where the probability
<BR>&gt; of getting the outcome that deviant
<BR>&gt; or something more extreme than
<BR>&gt; what we expect is less than .05
<BR>&gt; makes more sence that solving the
<BR>&gt; specific possibility of this outcome.
<BR>&gt;
