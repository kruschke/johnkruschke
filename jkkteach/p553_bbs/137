<P>Final grades are now posted. In the posted scores you will find some new variables, defined as follows:
<P>HWPC = proportion correct on homework
<P>EXPC = proportion correct on exams
<P>WTDPC = weighted proportion correct (.4 homework plus .6 exams)
<P>WTDPCEC = weighted proportion correct plus extracredit on first exam.
<P>ZWTDPC = Z-score of your WTDPC relative to the rest of the class (just for your info)
<P>GRADE: letter grade was computed this way: <br>WTDPCEC > 0.70 = B- <br>WTDPCEC > 0.76 = B <br>WTDPCEC > 0.82 = B+ <br>WTDPCEC > 0.88 = A- <br>WTDPCEC > 0.94 = A
<P>
