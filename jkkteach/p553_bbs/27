<P>
<P>&gt; I have a question about #6,
<BR>&gt; about how much additional money
<BR>&gt; would the experimenter expect to
<BR>&gt; pay subjects for the increase in
<BR>&gt; power. Do we need to figure expected
<BR>&gt; value to figure the amount of money?
<BR>&gt; I am not sure what formula to use...
<BR>&gt; and I think I should probably not
<BR>&gt; rely on what common sense is telling
<BR>&gt; me. any suggestions? thanks.
<P>This was supposed to be a simple question, intended merely to get you to realize that increases in power have a cost. In this case, we increase power by increasing the sample size, but each person in the sample costs money because we are paying him/her!
<P>The details for this question: Under the old procedure, when people are not paid, each person got 71 letters on average. Under the new procedure, when people are paid $1 per letter, they get 74 letters on average. With N=20, the cost of the experiment is $1/letter * 74_letters/subject * 20_subjects.
<P>The question is simply asking you, what is the increase in cost when you use 40 subjects instead of 20? That's the price you pay for the increase in power.
