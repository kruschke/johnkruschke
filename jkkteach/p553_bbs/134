<P>That would be *close* to right since it would be equal frequency of each, but truthfully the population that underlies the scores wouldn't be comprised of just 10 data points, which is why it's 10 equally likely categories (probability vs. frequency).
<P>&gt; What if I make the y-axis
<BR>&gt; the frequency of each score, i.e
<BR>&gt; 1 for each score? Is that right
<BR>&gt; or wrong?
