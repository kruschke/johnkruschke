<P>Question 5B (A&A q29, p.542) wants us to confirm a chi square of 8.79. It gives us the four groups and percentages of postcards written and sent, but not the numbers in each group. N=110 which is not divisible by four and it will not result in 4 equal groups. Since observed frequency must be whole intergers, is it up to us to determine the group sizes to give us the correct chi square or am I just completely missing the boat (for the N^3 time)? thanks, charlie
