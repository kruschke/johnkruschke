<P>Terminology: The phrase, "<em>proportion variance accounted for</em>", is an abbreviation for the more accurate but cumbersome phrase, "the <em>proportion</em> of the total <em>variance</em> in the predicted variable Y <em>accounted for</em> by the best linear predictions from the predictor variable(s) X."
