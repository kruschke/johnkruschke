<P>No t-test! Use F test (note that you have three groups). So you examine effect of word lenght of three groups of words. If this test is signitifican then there is some notable differentce between groups. You could use SPSS to do the final job.
<P>&gt; What does this one mean? Are
<BR>&gt; we supposed to do an independent
<BR>&gt; t-test?
