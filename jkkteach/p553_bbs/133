<P>What if I make the y-axis the frequency of each score, i.e 1 for each score? Is that right or wrong?
<P>&gt; This was the only question
<BR>&gt; on the exam for which there wasn't
<BR>&gt; an explicit corresponding question
<BR>&gt; on the practice exam, but certainly
<BR>&gt; it was implicit in doing any
<BR>&gt; sort of resampling test. All I
<BR>&gt; was looking for was a graph with
<BR>&gt; ten spikes (one for each of the
<BR>&gt; ten scores in the data set). The
<BR>&gt; ten spikes should be located on
<BR>&gt; the x-axis at the ten data values,
<BR>&gt; The height of each spike should
<BR>&gt; be 1/10, i.e., each score has a
<BR>&gt; 1/10 probability in the population.
<BR>&gt;
