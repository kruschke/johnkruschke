<P>Considering there's been no answer to this question, and I have yet to find someone who's been able to figure it out, I'm assuming we will not be penalized on this week's homework for not having figured it out...
<P>&gt; Question 5B (A&A q29, p.542)
<BR>&gt; wants us to confirm a chi square
<BR>&gt; of 8.79. It gives us the four groups
<BR>&gt; and percentages of postcards written
<BR>&gt; and sent, but not the numbers in
<BR>&gt; each group. N=110 which is not
<BR>&gt; divisible by four and it will not
<BR>&gt; result in 4 equal groups. Since
<BR>&gt; observed frequency must be whole
<BR>&gt; intergers, is it up to us to determine
<BR>&gt; the group sizes to give us the
<BR>&gt; correct chi square or am I just
<BR>&gt; completely missing the boat (for
<BR>&gt; the N^3 time)? thanks, charlie
<BR>&gt;
