<p>


<strong>Q560 is a new course as of Spring 2002. 

<p>
Any <em>current</em> Psychology major, <em>who has an undergraduate
degree in Psychology</em>, is waived from taking this course to fulfill
their Cognitive Science requirements. This is because Psychology
students have all taken experimental methods courses as part of their
major. This policy does not necessarily apply to students who
begin their graduate school after Spring 2002. The issue will be
reconsidered for future years.

<p>Some students have
asked how Q560 fits into the new program, and how Q550 (a course that
I have regularly taught in the past) is affected.  The Cognitive
Science Program now has the following required courses (or equivalent)
for graduate students:

<ul>
<br>
<li>Q520 Math & Logic Methods
<li>Q530 Programming Methods
<li>Q560 Experimental Methods
<br><br>
<li>Q540 Philosophical Foundations
<li>Q551 Brain & Cognition
<br><br>
<li>Q550 Models of Cognition, with new prerequisites of Q530 and
Q560. Q550 will have a different form than previous years. By assuming
knowledge of programming and experimental methods, Q550 will involve
more advanced and "hands on" modeling projects than in previous years.
<br><br>
<li>Q733 Colloquium series
</ul>

<br>Q560 will probably be offered every other year; i.e., Spring 2002,
Spring 2004, etc. The new Q550 will be offered in alternation with
Q560; i.e., Spring 2003, Spring 2005, etc.

<p>Cognitive Science graduate students who began under the old
requirements, but who have not yet taken Q550, are not required to
take Q560 (because it is a new requirement), but they are invited and
encouraged to do so. This is because the new version of Q550 will have
a component in which students design and collect data from their own
experiments, and Q560 would probably help make that component of Q550
more meaningful.
