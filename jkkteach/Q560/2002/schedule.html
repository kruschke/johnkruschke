<strong>Week 1:</strong> 

<br><strong>Tu 1/8:</strong> Brief introduction. <em>WRITING
ASSIGNMENT:</em> Write a statement of your research interests. The
primary goal of this assignment is for you to have and keep these
interests in mind as you learn about a variety of methods for doing
research. A secondary goal of this assignment is for the rest of the
class to be aware of the variety of interests of their
classmates. Turn in a paper copy of your statement, and post a copy on
the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q560_bbs/Q560.cgi">class
web bulletin board</a>. Due Tuesday 1/15.  <em>READING
ASSIGNMENT:</em> Chapters 1, 2 & 3 of the textbook. Due Thursday
1/10. The usual writing assignment (see below), i.e., abstracts and
application to your interests, applies to chapters 2 and 3.

<br><strong>Th 1/10:</strong> Discussion of Chapters 1, 2 & 3. Led by
Prof. Kruschke.

The first part of the course will involve reading the textbook. We
will discuss 3 to 4 chapters per week. Each chapter will have a
primary and a secondary discussant selected from the students in
class. <strong><a href="chapter_discussants.html">Click here for a
list of assignments of chapters to students.</a></strong> These two
students will provide a brief summary of the material in the
chapters. The primary discussant will provide the major summary that
lasts approximately 15-20 minutes; the secondary discussant will
contribute additional details or perspective for 10-15
minutes. Alternatively, the primary and secondary discussants can
arrange a team presentation if they wish (but they should turn in
separate abstracts and statements of applications to their interests).
The exact duration will depend on the content of the chapter.
Questions will then be addressed in open discussion. (Prof. Kruschke
will often not be able to restrain himself from lecturing
occasionally, of course.) For <em>every</em> chapter, <em>all</em>
students write (1) a brief abstract of the chapter and (2) a statement
of how the methods or issues in the chapter could apply to their
personal research interests. The abstract and statement of
applications will typically be no more than one page long (total). The
abstract and statement are due at the beginning of the class in which
the chapter is discussed.  Professor Kruschke will keep these
statements, so make copies for yourself before turning them in.

Beginning on week 9, the second part of the course will
consist of student presentations regarding methods used in published
research in their own fields of interest. Each student will select an
article from a high-quality research journal on a topic central to his
or her interests, and present a summary of the methods used in the
research and the conclusions drawn from them. <em>The emphasis is on
the methods and their use. The presenter should identify where the
methods were discussed in the textbook, if indeed they were.</em> The
presentation should last approximately 1 hour. Typically this only
allows time to describe a single experiment or study in sufficient
detail. Each presenter also prepares two questions that can be briefly
answered by students in the audience based on information provided in
the presentation. The questions are distributed at the beginning of
the presentation, and all students must turn in answers to the
questions at the next class meeting. The presenter turns in a copy of
the article summarized, a copy of the questions to students, and a
copy of any other materials used in the presentation (e.g., handouts,
overheads, powerpoint slides, etc.).

Beginning Thursday of week 12, the third part of the course will
consist of student presentations regarding methods used in
<em>proposed new</em> research in their own fields of interest. Each
student will (1) state his or her research question, (2) propose two
empirical studies using two distinct methods that are also different
from those reported by the student previously in the second part of
the course, (3) elaborate the procedure used with the participants to
obtain data, (4) describe data analysis techniques, and (5) describe
conclusions to be drawn from anticipated results. The presentation
should last approximately 1 hour. Each presenter also prepares two
questions that can be briefly answered by students in the audience
based on information provided in the presentation. The questions are
distributed at the beginning of the presentation, and all students
must turn in answers to the questions at the next class meeting. The
presenter turns in a copy of the questions to students, and a copy of
any other materials used in the presentation (e.g., handouts,
overheads, powerpoint slides, etc.).
