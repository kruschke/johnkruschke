Q560 <br>Experimental Methods in Cognitive Science<p> Prof. John K. Kruschke
</h2>

<p>
Q560 for Spring of 2004 will have a different emphasis than <a
href="./2002/" target="_blank">the version taught in Spring of
2002</a>.  Whereas the Spring 2002 version was a survey of empirical
methods across the cognitive and social sciences, the version of
Spring 2004 will emphasize experimental methods. The textbook does,
nevertheless, describe a number of non-experimental or
quasi-experimental methods. The goal of having this course in the Cog
Sci curriculum is for all Cog Sci majors to have a basic training in
experimental methods.

actually consists of links to expanded chapter descriptions.
