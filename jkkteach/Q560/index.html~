Q560 <br>Experimental Methods in Cognitive Science<p> Prof. John K. Kruschke
</h2>

<p>
Q560 for Spring of 2004 will have a different emphasis than <a
href="./2002/">the version taught in Spring of 2002</a>.  Whereas the
Spring 2002 version was a survey of empirical methods across the
cognitive and social sciences, the version of Spring 2004 will
emphasize experimental methods. The textbook does, nevertheless,
describe a number of non-experimental or quasi-experimental
methods. The goal of having this course in the Cog Sci curriculum is
for all Cog Sci majors to have a basic training in experimental
methods.
