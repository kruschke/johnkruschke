Syllabus (under construction!)
</h2>
<h3>Q560 Experimental Methods in Cognitive Science<br>Prof. John K. Kruschke</h3>

<p>
<strong>
Goals:
</strong>
<ol>

<li>Literacy in experimental methods. The student should be able to
read/hear a rigorous experiment report with good comprehension.

<li>Critical ability. The student should be able to generate
alternative designs to address theoretical issues, and be able to
detect potential flaws, infelicities, limitations, and shortcomings of
particular experiments.

<li>Productive potential. Although there will be no opportunity to
exercise this in the limited duration of the course, the student
should have the potential to generate experiment designs and analyses.

</ol>


<p>
<strong>
Grading:
</strong>

<ul>

<li>
For every topic, there will be a brief question posted on <a
href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Oncourse
(http://oncourse.iu.edu/)</strong></a>. There will be approximately
four questions per week. Students must answer the questions via
Oncourse within a limited time after they are posted. Some questions
might be multiple choice, others might require short essay
answers. Grading of essay questions will typically be on a 4 point
scale, with 0 for failure to answer, 1 for an answer lacking in depth,
2 for a good solid answer, and 3 for an exceptionally strong
answer. Most answers will get 2 points, with 3 points being awarded
only rarely. For student presentations during the latter part of the
course, the instructor will generate questions on Oncourse that must
be answered by all students, including the presenter. Of the
approximately 60 total questions, the worst four will be dropped from
the grading.

<li>The individual presentation of a case study will count 6
points. See the case study outline below.

<li>Final letter grades will be assigned according to performance
relative to the other students in the class. As this is a graduate
course, most grades are expected to be A or A-, with lower grades for
students with (lower) outlying scores.

<li>There will be no final exam or final paper.

</ul>

<strong>
Case study outline:
</strong>
Choose an article of interest to you. See Chapter 3 regarding literature searches. 
<ol>

<li>Title slide: Your name and date. Article title and author and
complete citation of source.

<li>What is the theoretical issue or motivation? (Ch. 1-3)

<li>Who/what are the subjects? Why? Were ethical standards obeyed? (Ch. 6)

<li>What is the design of the experiment? Why? (Ch. 4, 5, 9, 10, 11)
What are the independent and dependent variables? Why? What is the
procedure and task for the subject?

<li>What are the results and statistical inferences? (Ch. 12, 13, 14)

<li>What are the theoretical conclusions and limitations? (Ch. 1-3,
etc.)

</ol>

Presentations of case studies must be a maximum of 35 minutes long,
including time for questions and discussion in class!
