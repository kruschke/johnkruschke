<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your name and student
ID at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal <em>to the extent that they help you learn the material</em>;
nevertheless, you must write your own answers in your own words.

<br>p. 752, #8. Please write your answers in your own words.




<p><li> (12 pts.)

<br>p. 755, #15. Feel free to use SPSS or the Excel spreadsheets as
you feel appropriate, but explain your work and keep your answers
uncluttered and clear.

<br>HINT: First, notation for this hint. The levels of Group are
denoted Lar for Larger and Sma for Smaller. The levels of IBI are
denoted Bas for Baseline and Fee for Feedback. Thus, particular cells
are denoted LarBas , LarFee, SmaBas, and SmaFee. The interaction
contrast in part (a) is [ LarBas - LarFee ] - [ SmaBas - SmaFee ]. The
comparison in part (b) is [ LarFee - LarBas ] - [ SmaBas - SmaFee
]. Think about why. How do those comparisons relate to each other?
