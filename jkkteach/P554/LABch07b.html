<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Our goal in this lab exercise is for you to estimate the sample size
needed for a desired power in a two-factor design.
<b>You will need the F power tables from the back of the textbook.</b>




<p>Click <a href="ClaireMemoryExperimentSubset.sav">this link</a> to
get an SPSS data file. There are several variables in this data file;
we care about just three: The dependent variable is "total" and the
two factors are "picture" and "color".

<p>Check the data for strangeness: <li>Make a boxplot. Make it a
clustered boxplot. Set Variable = total, Category Axis = picture, and
Clusters Defined By = color.  <li>In a text box immediately after the
boxplot, answer these questions: Are there outliers to be concerned
about? Are the distributions severely skewed? Are the variances
severely different?

<p>Do a two-factor ANOVA on the data, including descriptive statistics
and observed power. (For our purposes, just ignore the fact that there
are unequal cell sizes.)  <li>Use Analyze -> GLM -> Univariate,
Options: Descriptive Stats and Observed Power.  <li>In a text box
immediately after the ANOVA output table, answer these questions: Are
any of the main effects or interactions significant? What is the
observed power of the main effect of color?

<p><li>Detemine alpha_j and beta_k for picture and color. Type your
answer, with explanation of how you got it, in a text box immediately
below the Descriptive Statistics output table.  <li>Assuming those
alpha_j and beta_k values are the values in the population, determine
n needed for a power of .9, for the picture and color main
effects. Type your anwer in the text box; explain what you did.



<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Delete everything
from your SPSS output file except the tables or graphs and text you
want to submit. Please be extra careful to make your turned-in version
clear and organized. Save a copy of the output file for your own
records, and upload a copy to the drop box in Oncourse. Go to Oncourse
for our main class page (not the lab sections), and attach to the 
Assignment for Lab Week *6*.
