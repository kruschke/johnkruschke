<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your full name 
at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal to the extent that they help you learn the material;
nevertheless, <em>you must write your own answers in your own words</em>.
