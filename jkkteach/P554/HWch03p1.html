<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your name and student
ID at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal <em>to the extent that they help you learn the material</em>;
nevertheless, you must write your own answers in your own words.

<p><li> (8 pts.)  p. 126, # 9a. (Do not do part b.) 

<br>(A.) Analyze the data by hand, using a 12-row table with columns
SubjectID, Group, Score(=Y), Predicted Y<sub>F</sub>, Predicted
Y<sub>R</sub>, (Y-predY<sub>F</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, and
(Y-predY<sub>R</sub>)<sup>2</sup>. Sum appropriate columns to indicate
E<sub>F</sub> and E<sub>R</sub>.  Compute F, look up and report the
appropriate critical values, and state your conclusion.

<br>(B.) Analyze the data in SPSS. Include the output tables with your
homework.  What more does the SPSS output tell you that was not in
your by-hand analysis?


<p><li> (6 pts.) p. 128, #11a. (Do not do part b.)  

<br>Do this in SPSS only. You might want to get the data from the CD
file. (Notice that the answer to this is in the back of the book, so
you can check that your SPSS analysis agrees.)


<p><li> (6 pts.) 

<br> Consider the data from #10, p. 127. We are interested in whether
the scores differed, on average, across the three experiments. Each
experimental group contains 2 x 12 = 24 scores. Use SPSS to conduct a
Oneway ANOVA on the three experiment groups. (Get the data from the CD
file.) Include the SPSS output with your homework. Answer these
questions: Is the restricted model significantly worse than the full
model? In general, if the restricted model is not significantly worse
than the full model, does that mean that the restricted model is true?
