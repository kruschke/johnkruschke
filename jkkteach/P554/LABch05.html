<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Our goal in this lab exercise is to do some real-world data analysis
involving multiple contrasts in oneway ANOVA.


Click <a href="FiltrationCondensationData.sav">this link</a> to get
the data file from Experiment 1 of Kruschke (1993). The task and
design were discussed in class.


<p>* Very briefly explain the planned contrasts you would make, based
on the theoretical motivation and design of the experiment. (You might
type this into a text document, then copy and paste it into your SPSS
output later.)

<p>* Check for outliers within conditions, using a boxplot in
SPSS. Should you leave them in or exclude, and why?

<p>* Check for approximate normality, using a boxplot and info from
Explore in SPSS. Describe your considerations.

<p>* Check for homogeneity of variance, using the Levene test option
in Oneway ANOVA.

<p>* Assuming that the above checks raise questions about the
distributions, transform the data appropriately. For example, try
arcsin of proportion correct. Re-do the above three checks.

<p>* Do the planned contrasts in Oneway ANOVA in SPSS. Important: What
is the significance level for the Bonferroni corrected tests? Which
contrasts are significant at that level?

<p>* Suppose you wanted the freedom to do any post-hoc contrast. What
would be the critical F value for the contrasts if you used the
Scheffe correction?


<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Delete everything
from your SPSS output file except the tables or graphs you want to
submit. Carefully type in brief answers to the above questions so that
your answers (and the question you are answering!) are easy to
identify. Save a copy of the output file for your own records, and
upload a copy to the Assignment 4 link in Oncourse.
