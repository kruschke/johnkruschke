<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Open a blank Word document for typing up your answer. Include your
name and username at the top.

<p>Consider the data below. "Y" is the dependent measure, and "Xmag" is
the independent variable that is measured on an interval (not nominal)
scale.

<pre>
Y   Xmag
4   1
5   1
6   1
1   2
2   2
3   2
2   3
3   3
4   3
6   4
7   4
8   4
</pre>

<p>* In SPSS do Analyze -> Compare Means -> Oneway ANOVA, with cubic
polynomial contrasts selected. Include the ANOVA table in what you
turn in (i.e., copy and paste it into your Word document).

<p>* Expand your data table by typing in explicit polynomial contrast
codes for linear, quadratic and cubic trends. Call these variables X1,
X2 and X3. Run Analyze -> Reports -> Case Summaries and include the
table of data in what you turn in.

<p>* Run Analyze -> Regression -> Nonlinear to fit this <b>Full</b>
model: Y = B0 + B1*X1 + B2*X2 + B3*X3. Include the ANOVA table in what
you turn in, and explicitly point out what number in that table
corresponds to the error (E<sub>F</sub>) of the Full model, and also
explicitly state the values for df, N, and #parameters.

<p>* Run Analyze -> Regression -> Nonlinear to fit this
<b>Restricted</b> model: Y = B0 + B1*X1 + 0*X2 + B3*X3. (Be careful to
delete the B2 parameter from the list of parameters.) Include the
ANOVA table in what you turn in, and explicitly point out what number
in that table corresponds to the error (E<sub>R</sub>) of the
Restricted model, and also explicitly state the values for df, N, and
#parameters.

<p>* From the last two parts, construct an F ratio. Be explict about
what terms (E, df) define the F ratio and the values that you are
substituting in for those terms. State what the F ratio refers to, in
terms of linear, quadratic, or cubic trends. Does that match anything
in the Oneway ANOVA of the first part? If so, state explicitly what it
is.


<p>Submit your Word document to the Oncourse Assignment for this
week. (Save a copy for your own records.)
