<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, <em>be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log</em>.

Our goal in this lab exercise is to produce one curve in the power
chart of Table A-11, p. A-28.

To do this, you will adapt the <a href="SampleGeneralizedF.SPS">linked
SPSS syntax file</a>. Recall from last week that this program samples
three scores (n=3) from each of three normally distributed groups
(a=3).  Recall also that the critical value for F, when the Type I
error rate is 5%, is F_crit(2,6) = 5.14.


You will be changing the means of the normal populations, and
estimating the power from the percentiles in the sampling
distributions.

<p>* Change the <tt>/PERCENTILES</tt> subcommand so that it specifies
2.5 5 7.5 10 15 20 25 ... 70 75 80 85 . This will allow you to estimate the
power to within about 5 percentage points.

<p>* Now change the mean of the second group to +1.0, and change the
mean of the third group to -1.0. (Leave the mean of the first group at
0.0.) Run the program. What is the power for this alternative
hypothesis, that is, what percentage of the sampled F values are above
5.14? What is the effect size <em>f</em>, and what is the value of phi
(Equation 100)? Make a note of the value of phi and the value of the
power.

<p>* Repeat the previous step, using second and third group means of
+/-1.2, +/-1.4, +/-1.6, ..., +/-2.4, +/-2.6 (instead of +/-1.0). In
each case, determine phi and the approximate power.

<p>* Now clear out the data editor of SPSS (File -> New -> Data), and
enter the phi values in one column (label it Phi) and the power values
in the adjacent column (label it Power). 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now display the Phi and Power values: <br>Analyze ->
Reports -> Case Summaries <br>Drag both Phi and Power to the Variables
box; click OK.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Now graph the Power versus
Phi: <br>Graphs -> Interactive -> Line.  <br>Drag Phi to the x-axis
and Power to the y-axis.  <br>Uncheck the "Display Key" box.  <br>On
the Titles tab, in the Chart Title box, type your full name,
and in the Chart Subtitle box, type: "df_num = ____, df_denom = ____"
with the blanks filled in by the appropriate numbers.

<p>* Look at the corresponding curve in Table A.11, p. A-28. Does your
plotted curve match the Table A.11 curve fairly well?

<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Clear out
everything from your SPSS output file except (i) the syntax that
defined the group means, (ii) the case summaries tables and (iii) the final
graph you made.  Save a copy of the output file for your own records,
and <em>upload a copy to the Assignments in Oncourse</em>.
