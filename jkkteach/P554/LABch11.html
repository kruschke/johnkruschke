<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Our goal in this lab exercise is for you to be able to reproduce in
SPSS (some of) the results presented in lecture.

<p>Load into SPSS the <a href="chapter_11_table_5.sav">data from Table
11.5</a> of the textbook.


<p>Do the following in SPSS:

<ul>

<li>Make a boxplot of four conditions. Do this by checking the botton
for "summaries of separate variables." The abscissa should have four
conditions, with a box plot over each condition. Are there outliers?
(Answer this in a text box immediately after the box plot.)

<li>Make a lineplot such that each subject has his/her own line (so
there are N lines in the plot). To do this, "restructure" the data so
that each score is in its own row, with condition coded as another
value. (After making the graph, reload the original data, so that the
data are structured one-row-per-subject.)

<li>Make a lineplot of the means of the four conditions. Do this by
checking the botton for "summaries of separate variables."

<li>Conduct an omnibus repeated-measures ANOVA on the means of the
four conditions. Using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for
non-sphericity, what is the probability of getting the data's F or
greater from the restricted model? (Answer this in a text box
immediately after the ANOVA output table.)

<li>Now conduct an omnibus ANOVA on the data as if they were from a
between-subjects design. Do this by first restructuring the data into
a single column, with conditions labeled as a separate coding
variable.  What is the probability of getting the data's F or greater
from the restricted model? (Answer this in a text box immediately
after the ANOVA output table.)

</ul>


<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Delete everything
from your SPSS output file except exactly what you
want to submit. Please be extra careful to make your turned-in version
clear and organized. Save a copy of the output file for your own
records, and upload a copy to the corresponding Assignment in Oncourse.
