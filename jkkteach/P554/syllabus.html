<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> This course emphasizes
analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied to experimental designs. A
thorough list of topics can be found on the schedule page (see link
above).

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../P553/">P553 or equivalent</a>.


<p><strong>Required Textbook:</strong>

<ul>
<strong>
<p><li> Maxwell, S. E. & Delaney, H. D. (2004).  <em>Designing
Experiments and Analyzing Data, 2nd Ed.</em>. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.
</strong> <br>Note: 2nd Edition only, not the 1st Edition.

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Check the authors' web site for the <a
href="http://www.designingexperiments.com/Errata/Errata%20List.htm"
target="new">textbook <em>Errata</em></a>, etc.:
<a href="http://www.designingexperiments.com/" target="new">

</a>

<p>Recommended Textbook. The textbook used for P553 is recommended for review and reference:
<br>Aron, A.,  Aron, E. N., and Coups, E. J. (2005).  <em>Statistics for
Psychology, 4th Ed.</em>. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc.
</ul>



<p><strong>Required Laboratory Sessions:</strong> You <em>must</em>
attend a weekly lab session. Each lab session will be devoted to (i)
discussion of homework, (ii) in-lab project, and/or (iii) in-lab quiz.


<p>Lab session times and rooms: 

<br><li> Thursday evenings, 7:00-9:00pm, in room PY A287.

<br><li> Friday mornings, 11:15am-1:15pm, in room PY A287.


<br>Attend whichever lab session you prefer; but you must attend one
every week.



<p><strong>Tools:</strong>

<ul>

<p><li><strong>World Wide Web:</strong> We will use a system called
Oncourse for posting announcements, homework assignments, discussion,
and posting of grades. Consult these pages frequently. To get to
Oncourse, go to <a href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/"
target="new">http://oncourse.iu.edu/</a> and click on the Login
button. You need to have an IU computer account, and you need to be
enrolled in this course. If you are auditing you can be added to the
course roster for Oncourse access; please contact the instructor.  (If
you have not already done so, please activate your computer account
and network ID immediately.</em> For information, consult the web
document <a href="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/achn.html" target="new">
http://kb.indiana.edu/data/achn.html</a>.)

<p><li><strong>Statistical Software:</strong> We will use the
statistics program called SPSS.  Information about SPSS, as
implemented at IU, is available from the IU Stat-Math Center, at <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/stat/spss/index.html"
target="new">
http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/stat/spss/index.html</a>.  SPSS is
available on all campus computers, and you can purchase SPSS for your
own computer for $25 from the StatMath center. For sales info, see the
StatMath web page.

<p><li><strong>Calculator.</strong> Your life will be easier
(especially during quizzes and lab projects) if you have a calculator
that has basic statistical operations including mean and variance
(standard deviation). It seems that batteries have plenty of power
until class/lab, at which time the batteries tend to go dead.  So you
might want to get a calculator powered or assisted by photo-voltaic
cells.  There are many different brands and models that suffice, for
less than $15.

</ul>


<p><strong>Assignments:</strong> There will be weekly homework
assignments that cumulatively count for 50% of your grade.  Homework
assignments will be posted on the Web.  Late homework will be severely
penalized: Each day late, up to three days, reduces the total possible
by 10%, and <em>after three days no points are possible</em> (unless
you have a cogent excuse, in which case you should contact
Prof. Kruschke as soon as possible, preferably the same day, by phone
or e-mail).  There are three reasons for this policy: First, the
course moves quickly and the material is largely cumulative, so the
late penalty acts as an extra incentive to keep up.  Second, the
graders should be given all students' papers for a given assignment in
one batch to maximize consistency of grading across students. Third,
the graders should not be given a flood of late papers at the end of
the semester.

<p>There will be regular in-lab projects and/or quizzes, cumulatively
counting 50% of your grade.  <em>The quizzes require you to work
individually and quickly, unlike the homework assignments.</em> The
in-lab projects also require individual work.

<!--
<p><strong>Disputing a Score:</strong> If you believe that a homework
or project or quiz score is mistaken, please re-submit the assignment
in question to Prof. Kruschke <em>along with a written explanation of
what you believe to be mistaken in scoring</em>.
-->

<p><strong>Missed Assignments:</strong> If you know in advance that
you must miss an assignment due date, please let Prof. Kruschke know
ahead of time, and it will usually be possible to make adjustments
(i.e., alternative due dates). If you unexpectedly miss an assignment,
contact Prof. Kruschke as soon as possible, preferably the same day,
via phone or e-mail. Cogent, documented reasons for the absence must
be provided if any accommodation is to be made.

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Grading is based on your
overall percentile relative to the class. As this is a graduate
course, grades are typically in the A to B range, and only rarely is a
C or less assigned.  It is Department policy to give incompletes ("I"
grades) only with a valid medical excuse.



<p><strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes, nor copies
of projector slides, are available.  If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and then please see
Prof. Kruschke or one of the assistants during office hours if you
have questions.


<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be suggestive,
not absolute. Any and all of the information on this syllabus is
subject to change at any time, including exam dates, grading policies,
office hours, etc. Changes will be announced in class.
