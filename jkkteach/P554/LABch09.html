<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Our goal in this lab exercise is to explore when ANCOVA increases
statistical power, and to explore how Post-minus-Pre differences are
not always helpful.

<p>There are four data sets to use, linked here: <a
href="AncovaDataRhoPos70.txt">Set 1</a>, <a href="AncovaDataRhoPos35.txt">Set
2</a>, <a href="AncovaDataRhoNeg35.txt">Set 3</a>, <a
href="AncovaDataRhoNeg70.txt">Set 4</a>.  <br>In each data set, the first
variable is the Group, the second variable is the covariate, which you
can think of as a pre-treatment score, and the third variable is the
dependent variable, which you can think of as a post-treatment score.

<p>For each data set, do the following in SPSS:

<ul>

<li>Click on each link above and save the text file. (You might have
to copy and paste into a text document if the line feeds mess up
SPSS.) Then load a file into SPSS using File -> Read Text Data. Name
the variables Group, Covar and Y.

<li>Make scatterplots of the data. Use Graphs -> Interactive ->
Scatterplot. In Assign Variables, drag Y to the vertical axis, drag
Covar to the horizontal axis, and drag Group to the Panel Variables
box. In Fit, select Method Regression and check Include Constant, and
in Fit Lines check Total. The regression line indicates the
correlation of Y and Covar.

<li>Do an ANOVA on Y. Use Univariate GLM with no covariate. 

<li>Compute the "gain" score, gain = Y - Covar (i.e., gain = Post -
Pre). Do an ANOVA on the gain score.

<li>Do an ANCOVA using Covar as the covariate.

<li>Compare the conclusions of the three analyses.


</ul>

After doing the above for all four data sets, answer these questions
(brief general answers are fine):

<li>Under what conditions is an ANOVA on the gain score clearly more
powerful than ANOVA on Y? The correlation of Y and Covar is relevant
to the answer.

<li>Under what conditions is an ANCOVA clearly more powerful than an
ANOVA on Y? The correlation of Y and Covar is relevant to the answer.

<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> For each data set,
save in the output only the scatterplots and the three ANOVA tables
that have the F and p values for the analysis. Type your answers to
each of the questions immediately after the corresponding tables for
the data set. Please keep your file uncluttered and be sure that you
make it very clear exactly what table or graph you are referring to in
your written answers. Please type your full name in a text box at the
top of the file!  Save a copy of the output file for your own records,
and upload a copy to the Assignments in Oncourse.
