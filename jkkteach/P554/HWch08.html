<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your full name 
at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal to the extent that they help you learn the material;
nevertheless, <em>you must write your own answers in your own words</em>.

<p><li> (6 pts.)  
<br>
p. 394 # 11. Please be sure to write your own answers in your own
words. You can use the answer in the back of the book as a guide, but
you must explain your work! Please notice that the answer in the back
of the book does not put the subscripts in "odometer-incrementing"
order, so don't get confused.



<p><li> (14 pts.)  
<br>
p. 397-398, # 16. Do this in SPSS. Before part (a), do this: Make a
boxplot of the data and say whether there are outliers, severe
non-normality or severe non-homogeneity. Important: Keep the answers
to the various parts well labeled, in consecutive order, and include
only the crucial parts of the SPSS output that you specifically refer
to in your answer. If your answer is not clear, points might be
deducted.
