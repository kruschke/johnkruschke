<p><b>Introductory Talk:</b> Thursday, Feb. 28, 9:00am-10:30am.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many fields of science are transitioning from null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to Bayesian data analysis. Bayesian analysis provides complete information about the relative credibilities of all parameter values for any descriptive model of the data. In NHST, on the other hand,  <i>p</i> values and the limits of confidence intervals depend strongly on the sampling intentions of the analyst, and confidence intervals carry no distributional information and are only minimally useful for predicting new data or assessing statistical power. Bayesian data analysis does not suffer these problems. The issues will be illustrated in the context of familiar <i>t</i> tests for comparing two groups. Bayesian analysis applies flexibly and seamlessly to complex models and realistic data, including small samples, large samples, unbalanced designs, missing data, censored data, outliers, etc. Bayesian analysis software is flexible and can be used for a wide variety of data-analytic models. And it's free.

<p><b>Workshop:</b> Thursday, Feb. 28, 11:00-12:00 presentation, 12:00-1:30 lunch, 1:30-2:50 presentation, 2:50-3:10 break, 3:10-4:30 presentation; Friday Mar. 1, 9:00am-10:20 presentation, 10:20-10:40 break, 10:40-12:00 presentation, 12:00-1:30 lunch, 1:30-2:50 presentation, 2:50-3:10 break, 3:10-4:30 presentation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop shows you how to do Bayesian data analysis, hands on, with free software called R and JAGS. (Installation instructions are shown below.) The intended audience is researchers who want a ground-floor introduction to Bayesian data analysis. No specific mathematical or statistical expertise is presumed. Topics include the following: Bayesian reasoning generally. Robust Bayesian estimation of differences between two groups. Decision rules and null values. Markov Chain Monte Carlo and JAGS. Hierarchical models: Estimates of means at individual and group levels. Shrinkage. <!-- Examples with beta distributions: therapeutic touch, meta-analysis of ESP. --> Bayesian hierarchical ANOVA. Multiple comparisons and shrinkage. Example with unequal variances. Bayesian linear and logistic regression. Overview of within-subject models and power analysis.

<p><b>Who may attend:</b> The talk and workshop are available to members of the FAA Tech Center, FAA Headquarters, and Human Factors Lab researchers and contractors. Other interested persons should contact Dr. Ulf Ahlstrom at 609-485-8642.

<small><b>Bayesian data analysis is not Bayesian modeling of
cognition.</b> Data analysis involves "generic" descriptive models
(such as linear regression) without any necessary interpretation as
cognitive computation. <i>The rational way to estimate parameters in
descriptive models is Bayesian, regardless of whether or not Bayesian
models of mind are viable.</i> The concepts and methods of Bayesian data
analysis transfer to other Bayesian models, including Bayesian models
