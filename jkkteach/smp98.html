<p><h3>You can lead a horse to water...</h3>
</a>

<p>Regardless of the topic, teaching poses two essential challenges:

<ul>

<p><li>One challenge is to convey ideas clearly, concisely, and
interactively.  

<p><li>But the <em>primary</em> challenge is to motivate the student.
</ul>

This talk addresses one way to motivate students to learn statistics.

<a name="emotion">
<p><hr width=80%><p>
<p><h3>Motivation is emotional.</h3> 
</a>

<p>The words "motivation" and "emotion" share a similar etymology.  A
student is motivated to learn when he or she has an emotional
investment in the topic.  An instructor is motivated to teach when he
or she has an emotional investment in the topic.

<p>
Good teaching of <em>any</em> topic is motivational and emotional. At
the 1998 National Institute on the Teaching of Psychology, Karen
Huffman presented a talk about generating "magical moments" in the
classroom, by which she meant moments in which instructor and student
achieve a sense of fulfillment, i.e., a sense that the classroom
experience has made a significant and meaningful impact on the
student's life. In essence, she showed that having both teacher and
student emotionally and personally invested in the topic leads to
fulfilling moments in class. 

<p>But how do you, as an instructor, get emotionally invested? She
suggested evaluating your own goals, not just as an instructor, but as
a human being. Decide what you care deeply about, and bring these
values into your teaching.

<p>Now the critical question: How can the topic of <em>inferential
statistics</em> be made emotionally engaging?  What deeply felt human
values can be incorporated into the teaching of statistics?

<a name="provoke">
<p><hr width=80%><p>
<p><h3>Provoke the premise.</h3> 
</a>

<p>One method by which to get students emotionally invested in
statistics is to pose provocative claims made by celebrities or
persons of power, regarding emotionally laden issues such as race,
religion, sex, age, drugs, diet/nutrition, and so on.  You can
probably find current examples in the popular media.  I will not
pursue examples of these here, as the best ones are the most recent
ones and the ones you personally find most compelling.

<p>Presenting provocative claims must be done carefully and
considerately, as it involves a risk: Some students might get
offended.  You, as the instructor, must be careful to present the
provocative claims without appearing to espouse them yourself (unless
you want to, of course).  Do not present any controversial claim that
you are not comfortable discussing.

<p><strong>Presenting provocative claims has one major goal:</strong>

<ul>

<p><li>to provoke a response of moral indignation from
the student; in other words,

<p><li>to get the student to <em>want</em> to disprove a
claim, in other words,

<p><li>to get the student to <em>experience</em> the
fundamental premise of statistics: <br><strong><em>You could be
wrong.</em></strong>

</ul>

<a name="ubidubium">
<p><hr width=80%><p>
<p><h3>Ubi dubium ibi libertas.</h3>
</a>

<p>Crucially, the "you", in "you could be wrong", could be anyone,
even a person of power; i.e., a person who controls valuable
resources.

<p>People in power sometimes do not like dissent, disapproval,
discussion, or disbelief.

<p><h3>One device for communicating this to students.</h3>
</a>

<p>In my graduate statistics class, I communicate these ideas to my
students by letting a far more eloquent man, Jacob Bronowski, do it
for me.  His video series, <em>The Ascent of Man</em>, was broadcast
in 1972 and it is still, in my opinion, one of the finest documentary
series ever produced.  Throughout the series, Bronowski emphasizes
that science is human and personal, that science is created by people
who are trying to touch reality, and that the products of science in
turn touch people.

<p>Episode 11, entitled <em>Knowledge or Certainty</em>, propounds
scientific knowledge as a profound expression of human
epistemology. Bronowski emphasizes that the entire enterprise of
scientific groping for knowledge is, and must be, conducted with
inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and with attention to the
possibility of error.

<TD>
<p><center><font size=+1>From <em>The Ascent of Man</em> by Jacob
Bronowski<br>Episode 11: Knowledge or certainty</font></center>

<p>[<em>The irony of the uncertainty principle amidst the rise of
dictators.</em> <br>The following passage was spoken at the University in
Gottingen, Germany:]

<p>Yet the Principle of Uncertainty is a bad
name.  In science or outside it, we are not uncertain; our knowledge
is merely confined within a certain tolerance.  We should call it the
Principle of Tolerance.  And I propose that name in two senses.
First, in the engineering sense.  Science has progressed step by step,
the most successful enterprise in the ascent of man, because it has
understood that the exchange of information between man and nature,
and man and man, can only take place with a certain tolerance.  But
second, I also use the word passionately about the real world.  All
knowledge, all information between human beings can only be exchanged
within a play of tolerance.  And that is true whether the exchange is
in science, or in literature, or in religion, or in politics, or even
in any form of thought that aspires to dogma.  It is a major tragedy
of my lifetime and yours that, here in Gottingen, scientists were
refining to the most exquisite precision the Principle of Tolerance,
and turning their backs on the fact that all around them tolerance was
crashing to the ground beyond repair.

<p>The Principle of Uncertainty or, in my phrase, the Principle of
Tolerance, fixed once for all the realization that all knowledge is
limited.  It is an irony of history that at the very time when this
was being worked out there should rise, under Hitler in Germany and
other tyrants elsewhere, a counter-conception: a principle of
monstrous certainty.  When the future looks back on the 1930s it will
think of them as a crucial confrontation of culture as I have been
expounding it, the ascent of man, against the throwback to the
despots' belief that they have absolute certainty.

<p>[<em>Science is a human form of knowledge</em>. <br>The following
passage was spoken at Auschwitz:]

<p>It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into
numbers. That is false, tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is
the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz, this is where
people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes
of four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by
arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality,
this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the
knowledge of gods. 

<p>Science is a very human form of knowledge.  We are always at the
brink of the known, we always feel forward for what is to be hoped.
Every judgment in science stands on the edge or error, and is personal.
Science is a tribute to what we can know although we are fallible.  In
the end the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: "I beseech you, in the
bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken."

<p>... We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute
knowledge and power. We have to close the distance between the
push-button order and the human act. We have to touch people.

<p>
<font size=+2>Thus, properly conducting a statistical test is a
profoundly <em>human</em> act, and is an expression of
<em>liberty</em>.</font>

<P><em>An imperative:</em> 

<blockquote>When you teach - even statistics - find ways to
make it <em>personal, emotional, passionate</em>; first for yourself, then for
your students. </blockquote>

<p><em>The reward:</em> 

<blockquote>
When it's emotionally compelling for you, teaching it is compelling.

<p>When it's emotionally compelling for your students, they
will value what you and our colleagues do. They will support it
personally, philosophically, politically and economically.  

<p>Teaching passionately is just enlightened
self interest.

<p><h3>Epilogue: The price of liberty and the role of tenure.</h3>
</a>

<p><blockquote>"It is the common fate of the indolent to see their
rights become a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath
given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he
break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the
punishment of his guilt."  <br>-John Philpot Curran: Speech upon the
Right of Election, 1790. (Speeches. Dublin, 1808.)  <p>"Eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty." <br>-abolitionist Wendell Phillips
(1811-1844) paraphrasing John Philpot Curran (above)
</blockquote>


<p><strong>Students, both undergrad and grad, are shockingly unaware
of the purpose of tenure. Stats class is a great venue for explaining
tenure.</strong>

<p>Students first need to be reminded that the reasonably pursued
truth is not always flattering to people in power, and that some
people in power will suppress their detractors.  Hitler and Stalin and
Pol Pot are good dramatic examples of ruthless power wielders.  Remind
students that United States Supreme Court Justices have tenure so that
they can interpret the Constitution as they see it, without threat of
losing their position by the capricious decision of someone in power.

<p>Here are some examples of victims in science:

<ul>

<p><li><em>Galileo Galilei</em> (1564-1642).
"Galileo's publications on celestial phenomena supported the
heliocentric theory (according to which the sun is at the center of
the world), and explained that this physical theory presents the world
as it is. This claim contradicted the Church interpretation of
Scripture. These publications and Galileo's attempts to interpret
Scripture according to this new theory, were not acceptable to the
Church. In 1616, he met inquisition officials a number of times and
they forbade him to support the Copernican theory (See the Prohibition
of the Copernican theory). This was the first part of his conflict
with the Church, which reached its climax at his trial conducted 17
years later." (Quated from a web page of the Tel Aviv University
Virtual Museum of Science,
http://muse.tau.ac.il/~museum/galileo/galileo.html)

<p><li><em>Charles Darwin and John Scopes</em> (1809-1882).
"... a Dayton, Tennessee courtroom in the summer of 1925. There a jury
was to decide the fate of John Scopes, a high school biology teacher
charged with illegally teaching the theory of evolution. The guilt or
innocence of John Scopes, and even the constitutionality of
Tennessee's anti-evolution statute, mattered little. The meaning of
the trial emerged because it was seen as a conflict of social and
intellectual values." (Quoted from the University of Missouri (K.C.)
web pages on the Scopes trial,
http://www.law.umkc.edu/ftrials/scopes/scopes.htm)

<p><li><em>William Gosset</em>. In 1908 William Gosset published his
work on the <em>t</em>-distribution under the pseudonym "Student".
Why did he prefer to be anonymous?  Partially because of personal
modesty, but also "so that the Guinness brewery would not have to
admit publicly that it sometimes brewed a bad batch!" [Aron and Aron
(1994). <em>Statistics for Psychology</em>, Englwood Cliffs, NJ:
Prentice-Hall, p. 251.]

<p><li>Drummond Rennie, health-policy professor at the University of
California at San Francisco, recounted a case where a <em>university
researcher</em> inadvertently let a clause restricting publication
slip into a contract with a drug company.  The study compared the
efficacy of one of the company's proprietary drugs with lower-cost
competitors.  When the study found little difference between the
drugs, the company tried to suppress the findings, Professor Rennie
said. He explained it took a seven-year struggle to get the results
published. During that time, the researchers felt harassed, especially
when other scientists with ties to the company tried to discredit the
research. The harassment included baseless charges of research
misconduct, according to Rennie. (From "Academics Face Abuse Of Rules
Designed To Protect Research" by Robert C. Cowen, Staff Writer,
Christian Science Monitor, March 25, 1998, p.13.)

<p><li>Botanist <em>JoAnn Burkholder</em> at North Carolina State
University at Raleigh has received wide publicity for uncovering a
previously unknown form of toxic algae responsible for massive fish
kills in Chesapeake Bay and other regional waters. They also send
toxins into the air that have poisoned local people. What may not be
so well know outside of her area is how vested interests in the
tourist business, including public officials, and chicken farmers have
harassed her. In outlining this, Dr. Burkholder explained that the
farmers' interests are involved because pollution from their farms
appears to encourage growth of the algae. She further explained how
efforts to discredit her work and her scientific reputation went
beyond normal scientific debate.  (From "Academics Face Abuse Of Rules
Designed To Protect Research" by Robert C. Cowen, Staff Writer,
Christian Science Monitor, March 25, 1998, p.13.)

</ul>

<p>Students should also be told that tenure is only a partial
guarantee. Tenure does not guarantee any particular salary level, nor
does it guarantee funding for research projects, nor does it guarantee
lack of harassment.



<a name="cynicism">
<p><hr width=80%><p>
<p><h3>Post script: Teach skepticism not cynicism.</h3>  
</a>

<p>The overarching goal is to turn students into passionate and
principled critical thinkers.  They should be reasonably skeptical in
all things.

<p>Skepticism can, and should, also be directed at purveyors of
statistical results.  A claim bolstered with statistical results must
be critically examined, as we all know "How to lie with statistics"
(Huff, 1954).  But this recursive skepticism must be taught carefully,
lest we inadvertently turn students into cynical relativists, the
exact opposite of  principled critical thinkers.

<p>My hope is that students come away from a course in statistics with
a feeling that statistical tests are a profound expression of liberty,
and are an exquisitely developed and still developing set of methods
for expressing doubt and pursuing the truth.
