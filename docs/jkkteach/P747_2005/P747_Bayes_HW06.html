P747 Bayesian Stats, Prof. Kruschke
<br>
Homework 6, Due Wednesday Oct 19, 2005.

<!--
<br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
-->

<p>General directions:

<li>
Make a cover sheet, without any answers, that has your name and
student ID number (not your SS number). On all subsequent sheets, that
have your answers, write only your student ID number (not your SS
number, and not your name).

<li>
Make a photocopy of your homework, and hand in the original and the
photocopy. (Of course, you might want to keep another copy for
yourself!) The copy, with the cover page removed, will be used for
peer-grading.

<li>
Show your work. When solving applied problems, first express the
solution or method in terms of general formulas, then plug in specific
numbers to get a specific numerical solution. Annotate the progression
of calculations so that a reader can understand why you are doing what
you are doing.

<pre>
# The code below creates a (prior) probability distribution over 
# two parameters, named mu and sd. The code will run, as is, to
# create a plot of the distribution. Your job is to extend the 
# code so that it grabs 1000 random {mu,sd} pairs from that 
# distribution, and plot those 1000 samples in mu,sd space. 

# Specify comb values for mu.
mu_min <- -30.0	# arbitrary
mu_max <- 30.0	# arbitrary
n_mu_bins <- 300	# arbitrary
mu_binwidth <- ( mu_max - mu_min ) / n_mu_bins
mu <- seq( from=mu_min ,to=mu_max ,by=mu_binwidth )

# Specify comb values for sd.
sd_min <- 0.0	# arbitrary
sd_max <- 40.0	# arbitrary
n_sd_bins <- 200	# arbitrary
sd_binwidth <- ( sd_max - sd_min ) / n_sd_bins
sd <- seq( from=sd_min ,to=sd_max ,by=sd_binwidth )

# Determine the area of a grid cell.
binarea = mu_binwidth * sd_binwidth

# Specify the prior distribution on joint mu,sd space.
# This is just an arbitrary weird function.
p_mu_sd <- function( mu, sd ) { 
	prob <-  exp(-((sd-2 -exp(mu/7))/sqrt(sd))^2) * exp(-((mu-0)/13)^2)
 	}
prior <- outer( mu, sd, p_mu_sd )	# unnormalized
prior <- prior / sum( prior )		# normalized
prior_dens <- prior / binarea		# converted to density

# Plot the prior.
windows(6.5,5.0) 
layout( matrix(c(1,2),nrow=1,ncol=2) ) 
contour( mu, sd, prior_dens
	,main="Prior Density"
	,xlab="mu" ,ylab="sd"
	,levels=max(prior_dens)*c(0.05,0.15,0.25,0.35,0.45,
						0.55,0.65,0.75,0.85,0.95) 
	,drawlabels=FALSE
)

# Now get 1000 random samples from the prior and display them in a second plot
# next to the contour plot. Make sure that the axes of the two plots use the
# same range. Use the method described in class, whereby you first get a value
# of mu from its marginal, then get a value of sd from prior(sd|mu). (Or, you
# could do sd first and then mu; it doesn't matter.) Fill in your code below.
# Turn in your complete program and its graphical output.
