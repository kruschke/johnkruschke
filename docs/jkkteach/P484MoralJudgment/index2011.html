<p><b>Course description:</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
course surveys recent scientific research about the psychology of
morality, broadly construed. Morality refers to interpersonal
behaviors that affect social structure, and to judgments of
appropriate behavior. Many scientific disciplines inform this domain,
including social psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology,
ethology, developmental psychology, brain science, cognitive
psychology, robotics and artificial intelligence, among others. (This
is <i>not</i> a course about religion, nor is it a course about
philosophy.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For an interesting overview of just a
few of the issues involved in the science of morality, check out the
talk by Jonathan Haidt, linked at the right. We will read a few
articles by Haidt, among many other researchers. The video represents
a small facet of a huge topic.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For another intellectual appetizer,
see <a href="http://symposia.templeton.org/darwin200/"
target="new">this video about <b><i>evolution and the ethical
brain</i></b></a>, in which journalist David Brooks interviews
neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt,
and philosopher Steven Quartz.


<p><b>Required readings:</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will
be reading more than 30 original articles from scientific
journals. The reading list is linked <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P657ScienceOfMorality/MoralityReadingsListOnly.pdf"
target="_blank"><b>here</b></a> and is also available in the Oncourse Resources for this class. 

<!--
Here is a list of topics to be covered

classes. If you have specific recommendations regarding "must reads",
please e-mail the professor as soon as possible.

<p><b>Pre-requisites:</b> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Advanced undergraduates who are able to carefully read, digest, discuss, and
present scientific articles are heartily encouraged to enroll in P457. Graduate students should enroll in P657. There are no formal pre-requisites.

<p><b>Course format and grading:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This is a readings and discussion course. The professor will present summaries of several articles, but most readings will be summarized in presentations created by students. Guidelines for presentations will be provided. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There are two types of assignment. The first type is a <b>major summary</b> of one article. A major summary can be either a PowerPoint presentation to the class or a long (approx. 3,000 word) essay. Students will express a preference for one format or the other, and the professor will assign the format type with the preference in mind. N.B.: The preferred format is <i>not</i> guaranteed, as there is a constraint that all the class days are filled with a presenter. Students will also rate their preference for presenting each of the 29 articles, and the professor will assign a specific article to each student. N.B.: The most preferred article can <i>not</i> be guaranteed, as there is a constraint that all articles are summarized by some student. The major summary (in either format, for any article) is worth 100 points, and must be submitted in Oncourse before the class meeting at which the article is discussed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The second type of assignment is a set of <b>short summaries</b>. Students must write short summaries of 20 articles of their choice other than the one addressed by the major summary (i.e., of the 29 articles total, 1 article assigned by the professor gets a major summary, 20 other articles of the student's choice get short summaries, and 8 of the student's choice do not get summarized). A "short summary" is 300-500 words, with about half devoted to a concise summary of the main claims of the article, and the other half devoted to thoughtful analysis and synthesis with other articles read in class. Be sure to state the article being summarized at the top of the summary. Each short summary is worth 5 points, and must be submitted in Oncourse before the class meeting at which the article is discussed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Plagiarism is not tolerated and will result in loss of points or other penalty according to university policy. Occasional quoting of articles is fine, as long as the excerpted text is placed in quotes and the source of the quote is fully cited. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Participation in class will be taken into account, worth 30 points total. The professor may call on people to encourage participation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There will be no exams (hence no final exam) and no final project. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Grades will be based on the quality of the major summary, short summaries, and participation in class. There are 230 total points possible. Letter grades will be assigned according to rank in class (i.e., percentile of total points attained), but there is not a pre-set quota for each letter grade. It is expected that quality of work in this class will be very high, and therefore there might be relatively few low grades, but low grades will be assigned when appropriate.
