Do boys or girls have longer first names?
Visit 
<a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames">
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames</a> and scroll to the
section called <i>Popular Names by Birth Year</i>. Select "2003" for
year of birth and "Top 50" for Popularity. When the table of results
appears, select all 50 rows of the info (drag your cursor over it) and
copy and paste it into an Excel spreadsheet, starting in cell A1. Your
Excel spreadsheet should now have 50 rows and 5 columns, just like the
website table.

<p>In your Excel spreadsheet, delete the values from the columns
containing the number of babies with those names (that is, clear the
third and fifth columns). Then, have Excel compute the number of
letters in each name: In the first cell of the third column (i.e.,
cell C1) type "<tt>=len(B1)</tt>". Copy that into all 50 rows of
column C, and do the same thing for the fifth column. The third and
fifth columns should now contain the number of letters in the
corresponding names.

<p>Now have Excel do a t-test on the lengths of the names. (Use Tools
--> Data Analysis --> ...) Place the output of the test in the
worksheet beginning at the first row of the seventh column (i.e., cell
H1).

<p>Print out one page that includes the top part of the data and the
results of the t-test. What do you conclude? Do boys and girls have
different length names, or can the null hypothesis of equal length
names not be rejected? Write your answer underneath the output of the
t-test.
