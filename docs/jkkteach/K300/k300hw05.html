<p>Be sure to <li>write your name and ID on every page <li>make a copy of
your homework for your own records and exam study <li>staple (not
paper clip) your pages <li>write clearly <li>show your work as
appropriate -- an unannotated sequence of numbers and derivations that
mysteriously ends up with the correct numerical answer will
<em>not</em> be given full credit <li>answer every part of every
question (unless instructed otherwise).

<li> 5 pts.  A researcher measures the IQ of 1,000 high school
students in Bloomington and finds that the mean IQ is 102. The
researcher decides to reject the null hypothesis that these students
were sampled from a population with mean 100 and SD=15, and declares
that "Bloomington high school students have significantly higher IQs
than the general population." What is wrong with that statement? What
is the effect size?

<li> 5 pts.  A researcher for a drug company measures blood pressure
decrease after a two week use of a new drug. Previous research has
shown that blood pressure decrease for a very large placebo group had
a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 12. The researcher gives
the new drug to 225 people and finds that the mean blood pressure
decrease is 1.6, and concludes that "the new drug significantly
decreases blood pressure after just two weeks of use." What is wrong
with that statement? What is the effect size?


<li> 5 pts. A researcher is interested in detecting decreases of
blood pressure caused by a new drug. She selects 4 people at random,
gives each a dose of 1 milligram, and measures their blood pressure at
a random time of day before and after the drug administration. She
finds no significant effect of the drug. Discuss three things she can
do to increase the power of her experiment. (Disallowed answers: Items
4-6 on p. 208.)

<li> 5 pts. Suppose a researcher wants a power of 84% for an
experiment she is doing. She knows that the background population has
a mean of 80 and an SD of 18. Her research hypothesis is that her
treatment group has a mean of 89. What is the smallest sample size she
can use?
