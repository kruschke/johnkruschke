<p><a name="goals"></a> <p><strong>Goals of the Course:</strong> 

The primary goal of this course is for you to learn about a variety of
methods for gathering behavioral data that can be systematically
analyzed to yield implications for underlying cognitive
processes. That is, you will learn about various methods for data
gathering, various methods for data analysis, and the types
implications that can be drawn from them. The second goal is for you
to learn about which methods might be best suited to your own research
interests, and to consider methods other than the ones you might
already be aware of. 

<p>In this type of survey course, there is always a trade-off between
breadth and depth. I have opted for breadth, for two reasons. First,
students (and established researchers) can easily get stuck using a
single method in their research; broad exposure to many methods can
serve as an antidote. Second, when a useful method is identified, the
student can easily find more detailed sources for self-study, but
finding the method in the first place might be the most difficult
part. Again, broad exposure to many methods can help solve this
problem.


<p><strong>Required Textbook:</strong> 
<blockquote>
<A href="http://www.sagepub.com/">
Breakwell, G. M., Hammond, S., and Fife-Schaw, C. (2000). <em>Research Methods in Psychology, 2nd Ed.</em>. London: Sage.
Paperback, approx. $28.</A>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> The first part of the course
will consist of reading the textbook, which surveys many methods for
data collection and analysis. Students will write abstracts and
questions about the readings. In the second part of the course,
students will find existing research articles in fields of their own
interest that use various methods, and report these to the class. The
presenters will prepare questions for the other students to answer
about the materials presented. In the third part of the course,
students will propose new research that uses various methods, and
report these proposals to the class. One emphasis is on exploring a
variety of methods, so that students don't get "stuck" in one dominant
research paradigm. Another emphasis is on understanding exactly what
implications can be drawn from different methods and analyses. The
course <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> provides more details.

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 

There are no specific prerequisites for this course. It is recommended
that you are a graduate student in the Cognitive Science Program. If
you already have extensive background in experimental methods, the
course should still offer you the opportunity to expand the variety of
techniques in your research repertoire. If you believe you have
already covered most or all of the material in previous courses, and
you are taking the course to fulfill a Cognitive Science requirement,
please discuss the possibility of exemption with Professor Kruschke.

<p><strong>Campus Computers:</strong> We will be making frequent use
of various computers.

<ul>

<p><li><strong>World Wide Web:</strong> We will use the World Wide Web
for posting announcements, homework assignments, and discussion.  Our
class web page is <p><center><strong> <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q560/">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q560/</a></strong></center> <p>(The
"~" [tilde] character must be included; it is located near the upper
left of most keyboards. Notice that the "Q" in "Q560" is upper case.)
Please consult these web pages frequently.

<p><li><strong>Computer Accounts:</strong> <em>If you have not already
done so, please activate your computer account and network ID
immediately.</em> For information, consult the web document <a

</ul>

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Grades are based on <BR>(1)
good summaries of reading materials, and clear presentations, in the
first part of the course, <BR>(2) clarity and incisiveness of
reporting existing research articles, and accuracy in answering the
questions posed by the presenter, and <BR>(3) creativity, accuracy and
thoroughness of new research proposals, along with clarity in their
presentation.


<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> A <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a> is shown on a separate page,</a> accessible from the web.

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be
suggestive, not absolute. Any and all of the information on this
syllabus is subject to change at any time, including grading policies,
etc. Changes will be announced in class.
