<h3>Course Description and Goals:</h3> 

This course selectively surveys some recent applications of
connectionist models to cognitive phenomena.  The emphasis is on
models that attempt to address detailed empirical data.  We will not
survey "generic" algorithms or architectures that are not directed at
specific cognitive phenomena and empirical data.  The survey will be
accomplished by reading and discussing various journal articles.  Each
student will lead (or co-lead) discussion of selected articles.  <p>

Each student will also program, from scratch, a connectionist model
applied to cognitive phenomena of his or her choice.  The model could
be a novel architecture or an existing model applied to new phenomena.
The last few weeks of the course will be devoted to presentations of
these projects. <p>

The course has three main goals.  First, students should gain
understanding of a variety of connectionist models applied to
empirical data.  Second, students should gain experience applying a
connectionist model to specific cognitive phenomena.  Third, students
should gain a better understanding of the role of models in explaining
empirical phenomena. <p>

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> 

<ol>

<li>You must have strong background knowledge in connectionist models.
This can be achieved by previously completing the course Q550.  If you
are self-taught or have taken some other introductory course in
connectionist models, please discuss the matter with Prof. Kruschke.

<li>You must be adept at computer programming.  We will not have time
to discuss programming methods much in class, so you are expected to
be able to program independently.  The preferred programming language
is C, but any language is permitted.  For all languages, the code
turned in with your final project must be thoroughly commented.

</ol>

<a name="schedule"></a> 

<h3>Schedule:</h3> 

The schedule below is approximate, and may flex and bend as the course
progresses.  The order of topics will probably remain the same, but
the exact dates for each topic might change. There might be changes to
the readings as the course progresses. Full reference information for
each reading is provided at the end of the syllabus. <p>

<p> <strong>Schedule of Project Due Dates:</strong><br> A brief
project proposal is due on the Thursday of the fourth week of class.
The proposal must specify (1) the empirical phenomena to be addressed,
(2) the type of model architecture you intend to use, (3) the
programming language you will use, and (4) which computer you will
use.  The final write-up of your project is due on the Thursday of the
15th week of class, except for those people who present their projects
on that day. For these people, the final write-up is due the next day,
Friday.  There is no final exam.

<h3>Grading Method:</h3> 

Grades will be assigned on the basis of (a) quality in leading
discussion of articles, (b) thoughtful participation in discussion
even when not formally leading discussion, and (c) quality of the
modeling project.  For leading discussion, quality is judged by
accuracy of content and by clarity of presentation.  For the modeling
project, quality is judged by many criteria, including but not limited
to the following: Appropriateness of the model mechanisms to the
phenomena being modeled; breadth and detail of empirical phenomena
addressed; clarity of presenting the model and the program code;
thoughtfulness in discussion of how the model helps explain the
cognitive phenomena, based on successes and/or failures of the model.

<h3>Computers:</h3> 

There will be two main uses of computers in this course.  First, we
will use the World Wide Web and a <a
href="news:ac.cogs.q750">Newsgroup (ac.cogs.q750)</a> for posting
announcements and discussion. Our class web page is

<pre>
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q750/q750.html">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q750/q750.html</a>
                                 ^    ^
                        upper case    lower case
</pre>
<p>

Second, you will be using a computer to program your own connectionist
models from scratch.  You may use any computer that is convenient for
you.  Connectionist models are typically "computationally intensive,"
so you will want to locate a fast machine.  If you have access in a
lab to a Unix machine or a fast PC or Mac, that would be fine.
Otherwise, there are various UCS Unix machines on which you can get
accounts.  For information regarding how to get accounts, see the Web
page <a href="http://sckb.ucssc.indiana.edu/kb/data/all.acop.html">
http://sckb.ucssc.indiana.edu/kb/data/all.acop.html</a> and get
additional information from the UCS Knowledge Base at <a
href="http://sckb.ucssc.indiana.edu/kb/">
