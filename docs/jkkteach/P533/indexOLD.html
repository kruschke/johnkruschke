<p><b>Overview:</b>
P533 is a tutorial introduction to doing Bayesian data analysis. The course is intended to make advanced Bayesian methods genuinely accessible to real graduate students. Advanced undergrads have also taken the course (and survived to tell the tale :-). <a href="#whyEnrollFigure">Figure 1</a> explains why you should enroll; see also <a href="#whyGoBayesian">these articles</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The course covers all the fundamental concepts of Bayesian methods, and works from the simplest models up through hierarchical models applied to various types of data. More details about content are provided below in the context of chapters from the course textbook. If you know some basic stats and want a preview of what Bayesian analysis does, check out <a href="http://youtu.be/fhw1j1Ru2i0" target="_blank">this video</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students from all fields are welcome and encouraged to enroll. The course uses examples from a variety of disciplines.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b>
This is <i>not</i> a mathematical statistics course, but some math is unavoidable. If you can handle basic summation notation like &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> x<sub>i</sub> and integral notation like &int;&nbsp;x&nbsp;dx, then you're in good shape. You will not need to generate mathematical derivations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We will be doing a lot of computer programming in a language called R. R is free and can be installed on any computer. The textbook includes an introductory chapter on R.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A previous course in traditional statistics or probability can be helpful as background, but is not essential. P533 proceeds independently of traditional ("null hypothesis significance testing") statistical methods.

<p><b>Grading; Homework; Exams:</b> There are homework exercises assigned every week or so. No exams or projects. Grades will be determined by performance on the homework assignments. All assignments are mandatory. There will be penalties for late homework unless you have a cogent excuse. These penalties are designed as an incentive to you because the material is cumulative; the penalties also help keep things fair to all students. If you must be late with an assignment, please notify the professor <i>immediately</i>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b> Please discuss the assignments and lectures on <a href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Oncourse</a> under the "Forums" link.  If you are attending the class but cannot get access to the Oncourse page, please e-mail Prof. Kruschke.

<a name="whyGoBayesian"><b>Why go Bayesian?</b></a> <a href="#whyEnrollFigure">Figure 1</a> gave one answer, but beyond that, sciences from astronomy to zoology are changing from 20th-century null-hypothesis significance testing to Bayesian data analysis, because Bayesian analysis provides rich information with flexible application to numerous models.

<p><b>How does this course (P533/P534) differ from S626?</b> The Dept. of Statistics offers S626, Bayesian theory and data analysis. S626 has a prerequisite of "two statistics courses at the graduate level", and provides a mathematical treatment of Bayesian data analysis.  Students are encouraged to consider S626 after taking P533.
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> All the information here is subject to change. Changes will announced in class.
