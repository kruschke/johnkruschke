Our goal in this lab exercise is for you to investigate the sampling
distributions of main effects and interactions.




<p>Click <a href="LAB_SampleTwoFactorEffectsBLANK.sps">this link</a>
to get an SPSS syntax file for generating sampling distributions.



<p>Read the instructions in the syntax file. Type your answers into
text boxes in the SPSS <b>output</b>. 

<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Delete everything
from your SPSS output file except the tables or graphs you want to
submit. Carefully type in brief answers to the above questions so that
your answers (and the question you are answering!) are easy to
identify. Save a copy of the output file for your own records, and
upload a copy to the Assignment 5 link in Oncourse.
