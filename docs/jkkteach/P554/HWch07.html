<small>
<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your full name 
at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal to the extent that they help you learn the material;
nevertheless, <em>you must write your own answers in your own words</em>.

<p><li> (4 pts.)  
<br>
p. 346 #8. Please answer in your own words, and be sure to explain the
computation of <i>df</i>.



<p><li> (8 pts.)  
<br>
p. 346 #9, parts a, c and d (not b, e or f) AND also do an interaction
contrast in which Desensitization and Insight are contrasted against
Implosion for the two levels of phobia. Do this in SPSS; cut and paste
only the relevant output table from the SPSS output to your homework,
and intersperse your written answers with the relevant output tables
to clearly indicate your answer to each part of the problem. (The data
file included with the book mis-labels the levels of phobia; don't let
that confuse you!)



<p><li> (8 pts.)  
<br>
p. 348, #12. Do this in SPSS. Again, cut and paste only the relevant
parts of the output, and intersperse your written answers to clearly
indicate your answer to each part of the problem.
