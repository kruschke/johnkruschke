<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in

Our goal in this lab exercise is for you to reproduce in SPSS some of
the results reported in the textbook. <b>You will need your textbook
for this exercise.</b> This week's discussion forum has the lecture
slides as an attachment, which includes examples of contrast
coefficients.

<p>Click <a href="chapter_8_table_12.sav">this link</a> to
get the SPSS data file for Table 12 of Chapter 8.


<ul>

<li>Reproduce the results in the first row of Table 8.16, p. 379. Do
this in SPSS by constructing the appropriate contrast coefficients in
an \LMATRIX subcommand. In what you hand in, include only (i) the
syntax you used and (ii) the small table that has the F value for the
contrast.

<li>Reproduce the results in the first row of Table 8.17, p. 379. Do
this in SPSS by constructing the appropriate contrast coefficients in
an \LMATRIX subcommand. In what you hand in, include only (i) the
syntax you used and (ii) the small table that has the F value for the
contrast.

<li>Reproduce the results in the first row of Table 8.18, p. 380. Do
this in SPSS by constructing the appropriate contrast coefficients in
an \LMATRIX subcommand. In what you hand in, include only (i) the
syntax you used and (ii) the small table that has the F value for the
contrast.


</ul>



<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Delete everything
from your SPSS output file except exactly what you
want to submit. Please be extra careful to make your turned-in version
clear and organized. Save a copy of the output file for your own
records, and upload a copy to the drop box in Oncourse. Go to Oncourse
for our main class page (not the lab sections), In Touch tab, Drop
Boxes section, drop box for Lab Week *7*.
