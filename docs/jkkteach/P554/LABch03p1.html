<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

<li>Suppose an experiment has three groups, each with three scores, as
follows:

<br>Group 1: 2.6, 3.6, 4.6
<br>Group 2: 4.0, 5.0, 6.0
<br>Group 3: 5.3, 6.3, 7.3

<br>In SPSS, do a Oneway ANOVA on the data. Can the null hypothesis of
no differences between groups be rejected at the .05 level of
significance?

<p><li>Now suppose that your null hypothesis is that the scores come
from uniform population distributions that range from 0 to 10 (not
normal population distributions). Can the null hypothesis of no
differences between groups be rejected at the .05 level of
significance? To answer this question, adapt the <a
href="SampleGeneralizedF.SPS">linked SPSS syntax file</a>. (Hint: Find
out about the rv.uniform function.)  Use your adapted file to generate
a sampling distribution of F(2,6) from uniform populations.

<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Your SPSS output
viewer will probably contain a mess of trial runs, revisions, and
finally correct runs.  <br>* Clear out all the trial runs, so that you
have only the clean final output of your answers to the two bulleted
questions above. Be sure the output includes the syntax (called the
Log in the output viewer) along with the tables and graphs. <br>* The
very first thing in your output should be the syntax (Log) of the
Oneway ANOVA. Double-click this log and type in (1) your name and
student ID number on the first line, and (2) your brief answer to the
first question, and (3) your brief answer to the second question. You
should click on the lower edge of the text box to enlarge the box so
your answer will all be displayed. <br>* Save a copy of the output
file for your own records, and upload a copy to the Assignments in
Oncourse. Go to Oncourse and click on the Assignments link.
