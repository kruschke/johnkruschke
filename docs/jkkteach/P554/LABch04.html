<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Our goal in this lab exercise is to demonstrate how some contrasts can
be correlated while other contrasts are independent.


To do this, you will adapt the <a
href="LAB_SampleContrasts.sps">linked SPSS syntax file</a>. This
program samples three scores (n=3) from each of three normally
distributed groups (a=3). It then computes the value of three
contrasts for each sample. Then it determines the correlations of the
contrasts across the random sample, and makes scatterplots of the
contrasts. Your job is to complete the SPSS syntax
(a.k.a. "programming code") and answer the questions below.



<p>* Open the SPSS syntax file. Look closely at the code and find the
comments, indicated like this: <br><tt>/* Here's an SPSS
comment. */</tt> <br>Some comments simply explain what the code is
doing. Other comments tell you to make some modifications.  Carry out
the modifications to the code indicated by the comments.

<p>* Run the code. Your output should have (i) a Frequencies table
that shows the 95th and 97.5 percentile of the contrasts, (ii) a table
of Descriptive Statistics for the contrasts, (iii) a table of
correlations for the contrasts, and (iv) two scatterplots. If you try
this several times, be sure to clear out all trial runs, and retain only
the final run.

<p>* In the top of the first Log textbox, type your full name. After
that, type in answers to these questions:

<p>(A) What is the value of
&Sigma;<sub>j</sub>c<sub>1j</sub>c<sub>3j</sub>? Are the contrasts
&Psi;<sub>1</sub> and &Psi;<sub>3</sub> orthogonal? What is the
correlation across samples of &Psi;<sub>1</sub> and &Psi;<sub>3</sub>?

<p>(B) Suppose a random sample has &Psi;<sub>3</sub> (=(M1+M2)/2-M3)
greater than the 95th percentile. For such a sample, what is the
probability that &Psi;<sub>1</sub> (=M1-M2) exceeds <em>its</em> 95th
percentile? This question is asking for the conditional probability of
getting a false alarm on &Psi;<sub>1</sub> given that you have a false
alarm on &Psi;<sub>3</sub>. You can answer this question by counting
the number of samples that exceed <em>both</em> 95th percentiles, and
dividing by the number of samples that exceed just <em>one</em> 95th
percentile. (And you can make those counts by clicking on the
interactive scatterplot and setting the axis limits so that the lower
limit is at the 95th percentile, which you determine from the output
table.) Hint: The conditional probability should be about 5%, because
the two contrasts are orthogonal.

<p>(C) What is the value of
&Sigma;<sub>j</sub>c<sub>2j</sub>c<sub>3j</sub>? Are the contrasts
&Psi;<sub>2</sub> and &Psi;<sub>3</sub> orthogonal? What is the
correlation across samples of &Psi;<sub>2</sub> and &Psi;<sub>3</sub>?

<p>(D) Suppose a random sample has &Psi;<sub>3</sub> (=(M1+M2)/2-M3)
greater than the 95th percentile. For such a sample, what is the
probability that &Psi;<sub>2</sub> (=M1-M3) exceeds <em>its</em> 95th
percentile? This question is asking for the conditional probability of
getting a false alarm on &Psi;<sub>1</sub> given that you have a false
alarm on &Psi;<sub>3</sub>. You can answer this question by counting
the number of samples that exceed <em>both</em> 95th percentiles, and
dividing by the number of samples that exceed just <em>one</em> 95th
percentile. (And you can make those counts by clicking on the
interactive scatterplot and setting the axis limits so that the lower
limit is at the 95th percentile, which you determine from the output
table.) Hint: The conditional probability should be much greater than
5%, because the two contrasts are positively correlated.


<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Save a copy of the
output file for your own records, and upload a copy to the Assignments
in Oncourse.
