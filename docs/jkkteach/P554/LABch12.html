<p><em>General instructions.</em> This assignment is to be done in
your lab session. Submit your assignment from the lab computer during
lab time.  If the assignment involves SPSS, be sure that when you open
SPSS, you set it so that commands are displayed in the output: Edit ->
Options, Viewer tab, check box Display commands in the log.

Our goal in this lab exercise is for you to be able to reproduce in
SPSS (some of) the results presented in lecture, specifically for the
analysis of Table 12.19 (p. 598) in the textbook.

<p>Load the data. Get the 20yr-old <a
href="chapter_12_table_7.sav">data from Table 12.7</a>. Get the
60yr-old <a href="chapter_12_table_15.sav">data from Table
12.15</a>. Combine the tables appropriately into a single spreadsheet
in SPSS. HINT: Follow the rule, one row per subject, and explicitly
code group membership. In SPSS you can first load one data set and
then use <b><tt>Data -> Merge Files -> Add Cases</tt></b> to include
the other data set, <em>but be very careful to properly add a group
code variable</em>.

<ol>

<br><li>Show the resulting data table in the SPSS output:
Analyze -> Reports -> Case Summaries.

<br><li>Make boxplots of the six conditions. Let the X-axis be the
angle factor, and let panels (in columns) be the age factor.

<br><li>In a text box immediately below the boxplot, state whether
there are any outliers, and briefly what considerations there are in
deciding to include or exclude an outlier.

<br><li>Run an ANOVA on the data. Be careful to properly define the
within- and between-subject variables. Also, define three Plots: The
average effect for age, the average effect for angle, and the six
angle*age conditions in one plot (like Figure 12.1, p. 607).  

<br><li>In a text box immediately after the plot of average effect for
age, type in the result from the ANOVA for the main effect of
age. That is, type in "F(__,__) = __, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected
p=__" using the actual (not corrected) df.

<br><li>In a text box immediately after the plot of average effect for
angle, type in the result from the ANOVA for the main effect of
angle. That is, type in "F(__,__) = __, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected
p=__" using the actual (not corrected) df.

<br><li>In a text box immediately after the plot of all six
conditions, type in the result from the ANOVA for the interaction of
age and angle. That is, type in "F(__,__) = __, Greenhouse-Geisser
corrected p=__" using the actual (not corrected) df.

</ol>

<p><em>What to turn in and how to turn it in.</em> Delete everything
from your SPSS output file except only those graphs and tables that
are relevant to the questions above. Be sure that the graphs and
tables are in exactly the order of the questions above. Be sure that
you text boxes are placed exactly after each relevant table or
graph. At the top of your file, be sure to add a text box with your
name.  Save a copy of the output file for your own records, and upload
a copy to the Assignments in Oncourse.
