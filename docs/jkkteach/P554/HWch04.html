<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
Homework for Ch. 4. Due at beginning of class, Tu 30 Jan 2007.

</h3>

<small>
<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your full name 
at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal to the extent that they help you learn the material;
nevertheless, <em>you must write your own answers in your own words</em>.

<p><li> (8 pts.)  #11, p. 188, modified as follows:

<br><b>(a)</b> Do this in SPSS by including another column of group
codes, labeling the first 18 scores as group 1 and the last 6 scores
as group 2. Run a Oneway ANOVA using the new grouping
variable. <br>* Include the ANOVA output table with your homework. 
<br>* What is
the conclusion of the test? <br>* Important: State the full and restricted
models involved in this analysis.

<br><b>(b)</b> Do this in SPSS. <br>* Include the ANOVA output table (with
contrast) with your homework. <br>* What is the conclusion of the test?
<br>* Important: State the full and restricted models involved in the
contrast. 

<br>Do not do parts c-g in the book, but do <b>answer the following:</b>

<br>* Why are the degrees of freedom different in the tests of part
(a) and (b)?  Answer this by explaining how many parameters are being
estimated in the full and restricted models in the two tests.

<br>* Can the test done in part (a) be expressed as a contrast
among the four groups of part (b)? Why or why not? [Hint: The answer
is no.]

<br>* What is the difference between the two analyses in terms of what
they are asking about the treatment and control groups?




<p><li> (6 pts.)  #13, p. 189, modified as follows:

<br>When it asks you to "test a comparison using MS<sub>W</sub>" you
should do the corresponding contrast in Oneway ANOVA. When it asks you
to "test a comparison using a separate error term" you should do a
Oneway ANOVA on only the data in the relevant groups, completely
excluding the irrelevant groups. You can accomplish this latter task
by copying just the relevant data and group codes to new columns.

<br><b>(a)</b> Do this in SPSS, as explained above. Include the output
tables of the analyses. Be sure to answer the question, How do the
results compare?

<br><b>(b)</b> Do this in SPSS, as explained above. Include the output
tables of the analyses. Be sure to answer the questions asked in
exercise.

<br><b>(c)</b> Do not do this part.


<p><li> (6 pts.)  #16, p. 190.  <br>Do this one as stated in the
book. Hint: To show that the set <em>is</em> orthogonal, you must show
that all the contrast vectors are pairwise orthogonal according to
Equation 58. Thus, you apply Eqn. 58 to &Psi;<sub>1</sub> and
&Psi;<sub>2</sub>, to &Psi;<sub>1</sub> and &Psi;<sub>3</sub>, to
&Psi;<sub>1</sub> and &Psi;<sub>4</sub>, to &Psi;<sub>2</sub> and
&Psi;<sub>3</sub>, etc. To show that the set is <em>not</em>
orthogonal, show that at least one pair is not orthogonal.
