<small>
<p><em>General instructions.</em> Please write your full name 
at the top of every page you hand in. Please collate and staple
your pages together. Please write clearly and thoroughly explain all
your computations; an unannotated series of formulas that mysteriously
ends up with the correct number will not be given full credit. When
doing the homework, you are encouraged to use all resources at your
disposal to the extent that they help you learn the material;
nevertheless, <em>you must write your own answers in your own words</em>.

<p><li>p. 620, #18 (8 pts.)  

<br>Do all parts. Use SPSS to do the analysis; include only the
relevant ANOVA table, not the whole output.



<p><li> (4 pts.)  

<br>Using the data from pp. 620-622, #19, do the following (just like
the lab activity):

<br>* Make a boxplot of the 15 conditions. Let the X-axis be month,
and use separate panels (in columns) for the groups.

<br>* Are there outliers? 

<br>* Use SPSS to do an ANOVA on the data. Also plot the average
effect of month, the average effect of group, and the 15 condition
means using month on the X-axis and group in separate curves. In text
under each of the three plots, report the corresponding result from
the ANOVA table: "F(__,__)=__, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected p=__",
using the actual (not corrected) df.


<p><li> (8 pts.)  


<br>* Consider the example explained in lecture, Week 7, p. 10 (see
overhead slides attached to Discussion of Week 7). There were three
factors in that experiment, all of which were implemented as
<em>between-subject</em> factors. Briefly discuss whether or not each
factor could have been run as a within-subject factor. For those
factors that could have been run within-subject, what problems or
benefits might have been created by running them within-subject? In
particular, would subjects' impressions of the arguments have changed
if the subjects are aware of contrasting conditions?

<br>* Consider the example explained in lecture, Week 4, p. l3+ (see
overhead slides attached to Discussion of Week 4). The conditions were
run between subjects. Briefly discuss whether or not they could have
been run within subjects. In particular, consider differential
carry-over effects (see, e.g., <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke1996CS.pdf">Kruschke
1996 <em>Connection Science</em></a>, the point being that not only
<em>are</em> there carry-over effects, but they can be the focus of
the research!).
