<p><b>Course description:</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of
the most exciting benefits of Bayesian data analysis is being able to
evaluate data "on the fly", as they are being collected, and decide
whether or not to continue data collection and how to optimize the
experimental treatment for the next observation. Bayesian adaptive
research design can be especially helpful in clinical applications,
when experimental treatments with null or detrimental effects should
be discontinued as quickly as possible, and treatments with clearly
beneficial effects should be disseminated as quickly as possible. The
FDA has recently endorsed Bayesian adaptive design (<a
href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm071072.htm"
target="_blank">Guidance for the use of Bayesian statistics in medical
device clinical trials</a>. See Section 2.6, regarding benefits of
using Bayesian methods). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bayesian
adaptive design</i> is useful for any application where efficient data
collection is desired. It has recently been applied to experiments in
cognitive science (e.g., memory and psychophysics). It has been
extensively applied in adaptive psychometric testing, whereby the most
diagnostic queries are automatically selected based on data collected
so far. It has even been used in astronomy to aid efficient
exploration of the skies. The statistical method can also be
considered as a model for how humans, as natural experimenters in the
world, efficiently and actively
learn. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course will focus first
on Bayesian adaptive design in clincial research, and then explore
other applications.

<p><b>Other required readings</b> will explore Bayesian adaptive
methods in other (non-clinical) settings, such as experiment design in
cognitive science, adaptive test design, and modeling of human active
learning.  Candidate readings are listed below (if you have specific
readings to recommend, please let the instructor know asap).

<p><b>Pre-requisites:</b> <br>A previous course in Bayesian data
analysis, including experience with R and BUGS, such as <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P533/"
target="_blank">P533</a>. We will be using R and BUGS to carry out the
examples presented in the required textbook (see the textbook web
site).


<p><b>Course format:</b> <br><i>This is a seminar-style course, not a
lecture-style course. Students will lead presentations of material and
demonstrations of methods.</i>

<p><b>Course grading:</b> <br>Grades will be based on presentation quality
and participation when not presenting. Exercises or mini-projects
recommended by presenters may also be assigned and count toward
grading.
