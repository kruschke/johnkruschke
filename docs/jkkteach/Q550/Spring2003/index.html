<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Professor John K. Kruschke, e-mail: kruschke@indiana.edu, voice: 855-3192, office: 336 Psychology, hours: by appointment. Web page: <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/">http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/</a>

<p><strong>Class web page:</strong> This syllabus and all related class info are posted at <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/">http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/</a>. It will be frequently updated, so reload it every time you check it.

<p><strong>New version of Q550 for Spring 2003:</strong> Unlike previous renditions of this course, Q550 is now supposed to be a "capstone" course that integrates Q530 (programming methods) and Q560 (empirical methods) with cognitive modeling. The course is also intended to be a "hands on" experience for students. 

<blockquote>
<small>The format of Q550 for Spring 2003 is very different than previous
renditions of Q550. Old versions were golden:
<br>
<li><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/Spring2001/">Spring
2001</a>. A survey of models in cognitive science.
<br><li><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/Spring1997/">Spring
1997</a>. A course covering exclusively <em>connectionist</em>
networks.
</small></blockquote>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Students should have previously taken Q530 (programming methods) and Q560 (empirical methods), or have equivalent experience and knowledge. Thus, you should have some experience with programming computers in some language. We'll be using MATLAB, which you can learn quickly if you have previous computer programming experience. You should also have some experience with collecting and analyzing data from biologically animate cognitive organisms such as humans. If you don't have much experience with these programming and empirical methods, take the course at your own risk!

<p><strong>Exemptions:</strong> If you already have extensive
experience in conducting experiments, analyzing data, and especially
fitting models, then the instructor will consider granting you and
exemption from the course. That means you will have satisfied the
course requirement for Cognitive Science, but you do not get credit
hours. Please contact the instructor if you believe that you may
qualify for an exemption.


<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Students will get experience doing four things:
<ol>
<li>Design and run a simple experiment relevant to their research interests.
<li>Analyze the data using standard inferential statistics.
<li>Program a simple cognitive process model for the experiment task.
<li>Fit the model to the data.
</ol>

<p><strong>Readings and materials:</strong> No required
textbook. Selected articles online. MatLab documentation online. See links below.

<p><strong>Web bulletin board:</strong> Announcements and discussion will appear frequently on the web bulletin board,
<center><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/q550_bbs/q550.cgi"> http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/q550_bbs/q550.cgi </a></center>
<em>Please <tt>subscribe</tt> to the bulletin board so that you will be notified by e-mail whenever a new posting appears. On the main message index, scroll down to the subscribe section.</em>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong> There will be various homework assignments throughout the course. Students will also make brief presentations describing their projects. A final poster and paper are also required. There will be no exams, but the final exam period will be devoted to a poster presentation session. The individual project will count for one half of the grade; the preceding homework assignments will count for one half of the grade.

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be suggestive, not absolute. Any information provided here is subject to change. Changes will be announced in class.

<li>Read  <a href="http://search.epnet.com/direct.asp?an=xlm2761385&db=pdh&tg=AN">
Kruschke, J. K. (2001). The inverse base-rate effect is not explained by eliminative inference. <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition</i>, <b>27</b>, 1385-1400.</a>. <small>(The online version has errors in it because the company that scans articles into the online database doesn't handle unusual characters and replaces them with "?". If for some reason the above link to Kruschke (2001) doesn't work, you can recover the article this way: Go to the <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/">IU Libraries Main Page</a>. Under the left-most column headed "Find Information", click on "Digital Resources". In the right-most column of this page, you'll find a list of "Top 10 Resources", where you should click on "Academic Search Premier (EBSCO)". The EBSCO page presents you with a list of databases; select PsycARTICLES and then click the "Continue" button. In the search-for box, type in "is not explained by eliminative" and select the "Exact Phrase" option, then click "Search". It should find the article. Then click "HTML full text".)</small>

<li>Understand the psychological ideas and their formal expressions in
the two models. If you like, you can read the article that describes
the EXIT model in detail (<a

<li>Understand the experiment procedure, the results, and the
statistical analyses. (Hands-on details of experiments and statistics

<strong><li>Individual projects:</strong>

<ul>

<li><a href="IndividualProjects.html">Follow this link for details and
suggestions regarding individual projects.</a>

<li>Each student selects a topic of <em>personal interest</em>, and
proposes a <em>simple</em> experiment and <em>simple</em> model for
programming in MatLab. Students are encouraged to base their proposals
on existing published research. The experiment must be short enough
that it can be completed by a participant in 15 minutes. The model
must be simple enough that the student can clearly explain it to the
class and be confident that it is accurately programmed in MatLab. The
model should also have a clear interpretation in terms of cognitive
processes; purely "descriptive" models do not qualify. The proposal
must be approved by the instructor <em>An example of all this is the
N. H. Anderson work studied in the previous section of the
course.</em>

<li>Each student programs his/her experiment in MatLab, and other
students are participants. Ethical treatment of participants will be
emphasized.

<li>Each student conducts a statistical analysis of the effects of
interest in his/her data.

<li>Each student programs the corresponding model, and fits the model
to his/her data.

<li>Periodic progress reports are submitted and presented in class,
and a final report.  The final exam period will be devoted to a poster
session in which students display their project.

<h2>MatLab resources:</h2>

We will be using the computer software called "MATLAB" quite extensively, for programming models, experiments, and data analysis.

<p><em>Where to find it</em>: MatLab and many accompanying "Toolboxes" are available on all I.U. public computers <em>except</em> Apple Macintoshes. If you want to install MatLab on your own machine, I.U. students can buy an annual lease through the StatMath Center, or buy directly from  <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks (the manufacturer of MatLab)</a>. The Student Version release 13 costs $99 direct from MathWorks, and toolboxes typically cost $59 each.  

<p><em>Where to get the experiment-running toolbox</em>:
The toolbox for running experiments via MatLab is available free. Use the following link: <a href="http://psychtoolbox.org/">Psychophysics Toolbox for MatLab by Brainard and
Pelli.</a>

<p><em>Learning about MatLab</em>:
<ul>
