Homework: Maximal Likelihood and Bayesian Model Comparison

<p>Please turn in your Matlab program, clearly commented, and its
output (with the answers to the questions below clearly annotated).

<p>
Suppose we are measuring some value of interest, such as the simple
response time (RT) to a flash of light. Here are the RT's, in msec:
345, 350, 365, 385, 410, 495.

<p>
Consider two models of RT:
<ul>

<li>Gaussian:
p( t | &mu;,&sigma; ) = [1/(&sigma;*sqrt(2*&pi;))] * exp( -0.5 * ( t - &mu;
)<sup>2</sup> / &sigma;<sup>2</sup> )

<p>
<li>Exponential: p( t | &mu;,&sigma; ) = (1/&sigma;) * exp(
-(1/&sigma;) * ( t - &mu; ) ) for t >= &mu;, and p( t | &mu;,&sigma; )
= 0 otherwise.

</ul>

where t is response time and &mu; and &sigma; are parameters (such
that &mu;>0 and &sigma;>0). We assume that the data are independent,
so p(data|&mu;,&sigma;) is the product of
p(t<sub>i</sub>|&mu;,&sigma;) for the data = {t<sub>i</sub>}.

<p>1. Using fminsearch (i.e., not using a closed form solution), find
the maximal likelihood parameter values for each model. That is, find
the parameter values that maximize the probability of the data.

<blockquote><small> Hint: Rather elaborate explanation is provided in
the Matlab example below.  </small></blockquote>

<p>2A. Suppose we have the following prior distribution over the
parameter values: p(&mu;,&sigma;) = k * 1/&mu; * 1/&sigma;, for &mu; =
250 to 500, sampled every 5, for &sigma; = 1 to 151, sampled every 3,
and k is set such that the sum of the probabilities over that grid is
1.0. Show a graph of this prior probability distribution.

<blockquote><small>Hint: <tt><br>m = 250 +(5/2) : 5 : 500 -(5/2) ; % row
vector of possible mean values <br>s = 1 +(3/2) : 3 : 151 -(3/2) ; %
row vector of possible sigma values <br>pMS = (1 ./ m)' * (1 ./ s) ; %
matrix of (1/m)*(1/s) for each m,s combination <br>pMS = pMS /
sum(sum(pMS)) ; % Normalized: each cell has a probability, not a
density. <br>% At this point, sum(sum(pMS)) = 1.0; </tt>
</small></blockquote>

<p>2B. For each model, determine the likelihood over the parameter
values (on that grid). That is, determine p(data|&mu;,&sigma;) for
every point on the grid. Show a surface graph.  Do the peaks of these
likelihoods match the solutions you found in Question 1?

<blockquote><small> Hint: See Matlab code for #1. Because we're
dealing with only six data points here, you can compute the product of
the six p(datum|m,s) without taking log's.  </small></blockquote>

<p>2C. For each model, determine the posterior distribution over the
parameter values (on that grid), given the data. That is, determine
p(&mu;,&sigma;|data) from p(&mu;,&sigma;) and p(data|&mu;,&sigma;).
Show a graph of the posterior distribution.  When you sum (i.e.,
integrate) across the parameter grid you'll be computing
p(data|model), which you'll need for the next part...

<blockquote><small> Hint: Let M denote the Model, D denote the Data,
and R denote the paRameters (shorthand for m,s). Then <br>p(D|M) <br>=
Integral_R p(D|R,M) p(R|M) dR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where p(R|M) is probability density <br>= Sum_R p(D|R,M) p(R|M)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where p(R|M) is probability (pMS)
determined in 2A.

</small></blockquote>

<p>2D. Compute p(Gaussian|data) and p(Exponential|data), assuming
equal priors on the two models.

<blockquote><small> Hint: Let M1 denote Model 1, D denote the Data,
and R denote the paRameters. Then

<p> p(M1|D) 
<br> = p(D|M1) p(M1) / p(D)
<br> = p(D|M1) p(M1) / [ p(D|M1) p(M1) +  p(D|M2) p(M2) ]

<p>where the priors are unbiased, i.e., p(M1) = p(M2) = 0.5, <br>and
where p(D|M) is explained in the previous hint.  </small></blockquote>

<b>Some Matlab hints:</b>

<p><li>Suppose that the particular data response times are in the vector
<tt>
<br>> t = [ t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 ];
</tt>
<br>The exponential model probabilities can be computed by the sequence of commands
<tt>
<br>> p = zeros(size(t));
<br>> p(t>=m) = (1/s)* exp( -(1/s) * ( t(t>=m) - m ) );
</tt>
<br>Notice the use of <em>logical indexing</em> such as <tt>t(t>=m)</tt>.

<p><li>When calling fminsearch, there is no way to keep the parameters
non-negative. That is, fminsearch does not allow you to specify limits
on the parameter space. Instead, do this: In your definition of the
model function, check whether a parameter passed into the function is
negative, and if it is, send back a Really Bad Fit value to fminsearch
so that it avoids that parameter value in the future:
<tt>
<br>> function fitValue = ExponentialModel( paramVector )
<br>> m = paramVector(1) ;
<br>> &sigma; = paramVector(2) ;
<br>> ReallyBadFit = 9.9e+99 ; % arbitrary value
<br>> if m < 0
<br>>    fitValue = ReallyBadFit;
<br>>    return;
<br>> end
<br>> % etc.
</tt>

<p><li>It is good programming style to keep the arbitrary data from an
experiment out of the definition of your model. That is, the model
really has two types of arguments: (1) the parameters and (2) the data
and experiment design constants. The model takes those two arguments
and returns a fit value. You can pass <em>both</em> kinds of arguments to your
model through fminsearch. The <a href="fminsearchExample.m">example below</a> shows you how.

<br>function fminsearchExample()
<br>%
<br>% Example to accompany Q550 Homework. The goal here is to illustrate the
<br>% passing of additional arguments to functions called by fminsearch. This
<br>% is useful for passing data and experiment design constants into models.
<br>%
<br>% This example puts both the Gaussian and Exponential models into a single
<br>% sub-function, which one would never do in 'real life'. But doing it here
<br>% illustrates the use of structures and switch statements in Matlab.
