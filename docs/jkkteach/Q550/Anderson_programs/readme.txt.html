                         November 1, 1994

     These files contain programs and documentation designed to 
accompany the book, "An Introduction to Neural Networks" by James 
A. Anderson, Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, Brown 
University, Providence, RI 02912.

     There are two types of files present in this collection.  All are 
in plain ASCII format.  There are no executable programs in this 
collection.  The source code for the programs must be extracted from
the text and compiled.  All the complete programs have been tested and
run correctly as of November 1, 1994 on a Digital Equipment Corporation 
Alpha workstation running Open VMS AXP version 1.5.

    The first group of files is a series of written Appendices, labeled
AppA, AppB, and so on.  These appendices contain documentation, Pascal 
source code, and some test files for the programs as described in the book.
The version of Pascal used, DEC Pascal, V.5.0-2, for Alpha AXP, has a few 
peculiarities and these programs may have to be modified slightly to run 
on different computers, especially UNIX machines.  However this style of 
Pascal is similar to the popular PC compiler, Turbo Pascal, and some of 
the programs will recompile without modification under Turbo Pascal. (Some
later versions of Turbo Pascal and other compilers may require addition to 
the programs of PROCEDURES ClrScr and GoToXY since they are not predefined.  
Working code for these PROCEDURES has been provided in AppA.TXT.)

     The other material provided is a longer set of programs called 
ASSOCIAT and BSB, versions of which were used for the simulations described 
in Chapters 15, 16, and 17.  The code in these relatively long programs is 
mostly concerned with human factors, and was not discussed in the book.  
Unfortunately, this code makes extensive use of string handling commands in
DEC Pascal, which is where DEC Pascal differs most from some other Pascal 
implementations.  A standard UNIX Pascal to C converter seems to do well 
on these programs, but some effort is required to convert them to the Unix 
version of Pascal.

     A manual for use of ASSOCIAT and BSB is provided in file
MANUAL.TXT.  

     Three examples of operation of these programs are provided in a set 
of Command files (*.COM) which provide the commands and data necessary to 
run several of the simulations discussed in Chapter 16.  (*.COM files 
essentially are lists of keystrokes used to run the programs.)  It is 
therefore easy to modify the command files for experimental use.  These
files are equivalent to redirected input from the keyboard to
a file in UNIX.  If a VMS system is available, the command files can
be executed directly.  

     Interesting neural network programs tend to be computation 
intensive and often generate and use large data files.  Problems
converting these programs to personal computers usually lie more in the 
size of the data structures used (Vectors, Matrices) than in raw computer 
speed.  To run properly on smaller machines, the dimensionality of the 
vectors and matrices used in the programs may have to be reduced.
