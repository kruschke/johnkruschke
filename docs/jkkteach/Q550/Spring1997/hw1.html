<p><strong>1. Framework for modeling.</strong> The diagram at right
shows the general structure of formal modeling 
(<a href="modeling.html">discussed in class</a>).
In this exercise you are to explain how some of the models described
by Anderson in Chapters 1 and 2 fit into this structure.

<p><em>1A. (4 pts.) The Nernst equation.</em> Consider the Nernst
equation on page 22:

<p>E = R * T * ln ( c<sub>1</sub> / c<sub>2</sub> )

<p>This is a formal model relating the voltage difference, E, across a
membrane to the difference of ionic concentrations, c<sub>1</sub> and
c<sub>2</sub>, on the two sides of the membrane.

<ul>

<li>What things in the world are being modeled here?  That is, what
corresponds to the "environment", "cognizer", and "behavior" for the
Nernst equation?  Give a few examples of other aspects of neurons that
have not been selected for inclusion in the model.

<li>What is the formal description of the "environment" in this case?

<li>What is the (direct) formal description of the "behavior" in this case?

<li>What is the formal transformation that predicts the (formal
description of the) behavior in this case?

</ul>



<p><em>1B. (4 pts.) The "cable" equations for neurons.</em> Consider
the voltage V at a point x on the neural membrane at time t.  The
"cable" equations for the voltage are


<p>V(x) = V<sub>0</sub> * exp( -x / lambda )   [p.29, and Fig. 1.16]
   
<p>and
  
<p>V(t) = 1 - exp( -t / tau )        [p.30, and Fig. 1.17]
 

<ul>

<li>What things in the world are being modeled here?  That is, what
corresponds to the "environment", "cognizer", and "behavior" for these
cable equations applied to neurons?  Give a few examples of other
aspects of neurons that have not been selected for inclusion in the
model.

<li>What is the formal description of the "environment" in this case?

<li>What is the (direct) formal description of the "behavior" in this case?

<li>What is the formal transformation that predicts the (formal
description of the) behavior in this case?

</ul>



<p><em>1C. (4 pts.) The neural input-output function.</em> On page 57
is given the formalization of neural input to output:

<p>g = f( SUM<sub>i</sub> a<sub>i</sub> f<sub>i</sub> )

<ul>

<li>What things in the world are being modeled here?  That is, what
corresponds to the "environment", "cognizer", and "behavior" for this
equation applied to neurons?  Give a few examples of other aspects of
neurons that have not been selected for inclusion in the model.

<li>What is the formal description of the "environment" in this case?

<li>What is the (direct) formal description of the "behavior" in this case?

<li>What is the formal transformation that predicts the (formal
description of the) behavior in this case?

</ul>




<p><strong>2. Familiarization with PDP software.</strong> This
exercise is intended to familiarize you with the PDP software.
Because many of the properties of the PDP software are introduced with
the <tt>iac</tt> program, it will be our first exposure to the
software, despite the fact that the <tt>iac</tt> architecture is more
complicated than the single-layer feed-forward networks that will
begin our systematic explorations.

<p><em>2A. (5 pts.) Running the program.</em> Work through Exercise
2.1, starting on page 38 of the PDP book, up to but not including
question Q.2.1.1 (p. 43).  Save the screen of at this point, and print
it out (it should look something like Fig. 4, p. 44).  Turn in your
print out.

<p><em>2B. (5 pts.) Logging and plotting results.</em> Work through
Appendix D of the PDP book (pp. 283-288).  Make a graph like Figure 1,
page 287, and turn it in.

<p><strong>3. "Essential Vector Operations".</strong> This exercise is
intended to make sure you review Chapter 3 of Anderson.

<p><em>3A. (2 pts.) Normalization.</em> Normalize the vector (2,2).

<p><em>3B. (3 pts.) Walsh functions.</em> Figure out four orthogonal
Walsh vectors for a four-dimensional space.  Demonstrate that they
are, in fact, orthogonal.

<p><em>3C. (3 pts.) Linear dependence.</em> Show that (2,2) is a
linear combination of (1,0) and (0,1).  Show that (2,2) is a linear
combination of (1,1) and (1,-1).  Show that (2,2) is a linear
combination of (-1,2) and (2,-1).  In other words, for each case, what
linear combination of the vectors results in (2,2)?
