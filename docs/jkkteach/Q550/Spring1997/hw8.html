<p><strong>20 pts. total</strong>
</center>

<p><strong>1. The word-superiority effect (10 pts.)</strong> Do
exercises Q.7.1.1 (p.230) and Q.7.2.1 (p.232) from PDPIII.  You should
look at the answers provided in the back of the book, but write your
own answers in your own words.  Please also provide print-outs of your
screens at the end of processing each stimulus.

<p><strong>2. Arithmetic and extrapolation (5 pts.)</strong> On p.607
of Anderson, Figure 17.14 shows "the human multiplication algorithm".
Suppose that the algorithm was trained on the 12-by-12 multiplication
table (i.e., 1x1=1, 1x2=2, ...  12x11=132, 12x12=144).  Could it solve
the problem 10x20?  Why not?  

<p>What other processing do people possess that this "human
multiplication algorithm" does not?

<p><strong>3. Categorization and extrapolation, again (5
pts.)</strong> On p.614, Anderson states that "extrapolation is far
more difficult than interpolation."  Consider the extrapolation
situation from Homework 4B, reproduced in part below:


<pre>
 ^.......
 |.....?.
 |.X.....
 |...E...
 |.......
 |....X..
 |.......
 +------->
</pre>

<p>Suppose the stimuli are encoded using the hybrid coding scheme
described by Anderson in Chapter 17, as follows:

<pre>
 Symbolic           Analogue
   Part               Part
             Dim 1           Dim 2
  X .    = = = . . . .   . . . = = = .
  X .    . . . = = = .   = = = . . . .
  . E    . . = = = . .   . . = = = . .
  ? ?    . . . . = = =   . . . . = = =
</pre>

<p>Could a BSB network learn the three training patterns (X, X and E)?
(Careful - see pp.166-168 of PDPIII.)  Assume it is trained using the
delta rule.

<p>For a BSB network that learned the three training patterns, how
would it fill in the symbolic part if tested with the "?" stimulus?
That is, if the analogue part of the "?" stimulus were clamped on, how
would the symbolic part be filled in, as an "X" or as an "E"?
