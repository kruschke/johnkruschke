<p><dt>April 4: <dd><strong>Copper users:</strong> Homework 5 won't
work right on Copper because the <tt>%r</tt> (randomize weights)
command doesn't execute properly.  See the newly added comments on <a
href="hw5.html">Homework 5</a>.

<p><dt>March 11: <dd><strong>Homework 4A, Question 2C:</strong> The
question asks why all the output nodes are near zero when the input
pattern is 1111.  It turns out that the output nodes are <em>not</em>
always all near zero on every training run, but, on most training
runs, the output nodes will be nearer to zero than to one.  To answer
the question, <em>suppose</em> that all the output activations are
near zero when the input pattern is 1111.

<p><dt>March 11: <dd><strong>bp on copper</strong> does not work;
instead use <strong>bp.hacked</strong>.  That is, instead of typing
"bp 424.tem 424.str", type "bp.hacked 424.tem 424.str" (after you have
copied the program into your own directory).

<p><dt>February 11: <dd><strong>Homework 2 due date is postponed until
Tuesday Feb. 18.</strong>

<p><dt>January 16: <dd><strong>Homework may be turned in via
e-mail</strong> to Matthias, it you like.  E-mail homework is
preferred, but not required.

<p><dt>January 16: <dd><strong>The PDP software</strong> is available
on the Unix machine, copper, in directories under /usr/pub/pdp/.  You
can <a

account on copper</a> via the web.
