<p><strong>Course Description and Goals:</strong> This course is an
introduction to connectionist models in cognitive science. The course
is organized around a progressive increase in the architectural
complexity of the models, rather than around topics of application
(see the <a href="schedule.html">schedule of topics</a> on a separate
page).  Applications to perception, memory, language, reasoning,
neuro-psychology, etc., will be studied as concrete illustrations of
general computational properties of the architectures.

<p>One goal of the course is for you to understand the generic
properties of connectionist models, independent of particular
applications.  Applications to particular topics will illustrate the
general computational properties.  As a consequence, the behaviors of
these applications will be explicated.

<p>A second goal of the course is for you to better understand the
role of (connectionist) models in <em>explaining</em> the cognitive
phenomena being modeled.  In the best models, there is a clear
correspondence between (1) the informal explanatory principles for the
cognitive phenomena and (2) the formal computational mechanisms in the
model.  (This is explored more deeply in the more advanced course, <a
href="../Q750/">Q750</a>.)


<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 

<ul>

<p><li><em>Mathematics:</em> Lectures will emphasize mathematical
properties, but homework assignments will emphasize hands-on
experimentation with models and will not require much mathematical
manipulation.  Nevertheless, <em>students with a good working
knowledge of calculus and linear algebra will get the most out of the
course</em>.

<p><li><em>Cognitive Science:</em> Some background in cognitive
science (e.g., Q500) is helpful but not required.

<p><li><em>Computer Programming:</em> No actual programming is
required.  We will be using pre-packaged programs written in C (and
possibly others written in Pascal).  You will, however, need to edit
and manipulate computer files.

</ul>
  
<p><strong>Required Textbooks:</strong> 

<ul>

<p><li>Anderson, J. A. (1995). <em>An introduction to neural
networks</em>.  Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

<p><li>McClelland, J. L. & Rumelhart, D.E. (1988). <em>Explorations in
parallel distributed processing</em>.  Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
<p>This book comes with software for either Macintosh or PC, but not
both; get the version you prefer.  Along with two companion volumes
published in 1986, this book is often referred to as <em>the PDP
book</em>.


</ul>

<p><strong>Computers:</strong> We will be making extensive use
of the various campus computers.  

<ul>

<li><em>Network ID:</em> If you have not already done so,
please activate your IU computer accounts immediately.  To do so, take
a photo ID to 084 IMU.  Even if you already have your accounts
activated, it can help to make sure you have a <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/cgi-bin-ip/ucshelp/networkid.cgi">
network ID</a>.

<p><li><em>World Wide Web:</em> We will use the World Wide Web
for posting announcements, homework assignments, and discussion.  Our
class home page is

                                 upper case "Q"
</pre>

<p><li><em>PDP Software:</em> We will definitely be using the programs
supplied with the PDP book.  Availability on shared Unix computers
will be discussed in class.

<p><li><em>J. A. Anderson Software:</em> We might be using software
referred to in the Anderson book.  This will be announced in class.


</ul>

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> There are eight homework assignments
corresponding to the eight main topical divisions of the course (see
the <a href="schedule.html">schedule of topics</a>).  Different
assignments will be of different length, and they are worth different
numbers of points toward your course grade.  The points for each
homework will be explicitly marked on each exercise.

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Course grades are based on
performance on the homework assignments.  There are no exams and no
papers.  Grading is "on a curve" insofar as individual grades are
assigned relative to the central tendency of all students in the
course, but there is no preset shape of the grade distribution.  As
this is a graduate course, most grades will probably be A's or B's,
with C's (or lower) assigned only rarely.

<p><strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes, nor copies
of overhead projector slides, are available.  If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and then please see Prof.
Kruschke or the assistant if you have questions.

<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> A <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a> is shown on a separate page.</a>

<p><strong><a href="instructor.html">Instructor and Assistant Contact
Information</strong></a> is listed on a separate page.

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be
suggestive, not absolute. Any and all of the information on this
syllabus is subject to change at any time, including exam or homework
dates, grading policies, office hours, etc. Changes will be announced
in class.
