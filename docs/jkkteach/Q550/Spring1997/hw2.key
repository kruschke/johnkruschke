Q550 Homework 2: Linear Networks, Part 2.

**** KEY ****

1. Feature and Pattern Levels of Representation. Suppose we have some
very simple pictures consisting of two pixels.  We set up a linear
network of two input nodes and two output nodes, and we want it to
learn to associate pictures.  Just what the nodes represent about the
pictures is up to us, however.  We'll consider two different
representations: a "feature" representation and a "pattern"
representation.

Feature basis: If we consider individual pixels to be features, then
it is natural to define a "feature" (or "pixel") basis:

 (1,0)     (0,1)

That's supposed to indicate two pictures; one picture has grey levels
1 and 0, the other 0 and 1.  Any picture can be described as some
linear combination of those two basis pictures, and the coefficients
in the resulting linear combination (i.e., the coordinates) are the
input activations (and teacher values) for the feature-based network.

Pattern basis: Let's also define a pattern basis, consisting of a
uniform picture and a "ramp" picture:

 (1,1)     (.25,.75)

Again, any picture can be described as some linear combination of
those two basis pictures, and the coefficients in that linear
combination (i.e., the coordinates) are the input activations (and
teacher values) for the pattern-based network.

From that choice of bases it follows that the change-of-basis matrices
are 

  -1   [ 1.0 0.25 ]                [  1.5 -0.5 ]
 P   = [ 1.0 0.75 ]      and   P = [ -2.0  2.0 ]

for patterns-to-features and features-to-patterns, respectively.  (The
"-1" over the "P" means that the matrix on the left is the inverse of
the matrix on the right.)  

For example, consider the picture (1,1).  In the feature basis, it has
coordinates 1 and 1 (i.e., 1 times the first feature basis vector plus
1 times the second feature basis vector).  What are its coordinates in
the pattern basis?  By inspection, we can see that the coordinates
must be 1 and 0, because the picture _is_ the first pattern basis
vector.  But let's see if the change of basis matrix gives us that
answer:

 [  1.5 -0.5 ]  [ 1 ]  =  [ 1 ]
 [ -2.0  2.0 ]  [ 1 ]     [ 0 ]

Yes! It works!  Remember, the change of basis matrix operates on
coordinates, not on pictures.  I've tried to distinguish pictures from
coordinates by putting picture grey-levels in parentheses, and
coordinates in vertical columns enclosed with brackets.

Suppose we want to associate the following pictures:

    in           out              in           out
 (1.0,0.0) => (0.5,0.5)        (0.0,1.0) => (1.0,0.0)


1A. Express those associations in terms of coordinates.  First, what
are the corresponding associations in terms of feature coordinates?
Second, what are the corresponding associations in terms of pattern
coordinates? (For the second part, use the change of basis matrix.)

**** 
     Feature basis:
     
           [ 1.0 ]  =>  [ 0.5 ]      [ 0.0 ]  =>  [ 1.0 ]
           [ 0.0 ]      [ 0.5 ]      [ 1.0 ]      [ 0.0 ]
     
     Pattern basis:  
     Multiply all of those by the matrix P, to get:
     
           [ 1.5 ]  =>  [ 0.5 ]      [-0.5 ]  =>  [ 1.5 ]
           [-2.0 ]      [ 0.0 ]      [ 2.0 ]      [-2.0 ]
     

1B. Isomorphism at Asymptote. Use the "pa" program in delta-rule mode
to see if the feature-based and pattern-based networks converge to
"similar" weight matrices, where "similar" is used in the technical
sense. That is, if W_F is the asymptotic weight matrix for the
feature-based network, and W_P is the asymptotic weight matrix for the
pattern-based network, show that W_F = P^-1 * W_P * P (where P^-1
means P inverse).

**** 
     At asymptote, W_F = [  0.50  1.00 ]
                         [  0.50  0.00 ]
     
     and           W_P = [  2.00  1.25 ]
                         [ -2.00 -1.50 ]
     
     
     Then
     
     P^-1 * W_P * P = [ 1.0 0.25 ] [  2.0  1.25 ] [  1.5 -0.5 ]
                      [ 1.0 0.75 ] [ -2.0 -1.50 ] [ -2.0  2.0 ]
     
                    = [ 1.0 0.25 ] [ 0.5  1.5 ]
                      [ 1.0 0.75 ] [ 0.0 -2.0 ]
     
                    = [ 0.5 1.0 ]
                      [ 0.5 0.0 ]
     
                    = W_F


1C. Non-Isomorphic Course of Training. Now test whether the weight
matrices are similar throughout the course of training.  Are the
feature-based and pattern-based weight matrices "similar" (in the
technical sense) after 5 epochs of training?

**** 
     After 5 epochs, W_F = [  0.24  0.48 ]
                           [  0.24  0.00 ]
     
     and             W_P = [  0.46  0.47 ]
                           [ -0.39 -0.79 ]
     
     
     Then
     
     P^-1 * W_P * P = [ 1.0 0.25 ] [  0.46  0.47 ] [  1.5 -0.5 ]
                      [ 1.0 0.75 ] [ -0.39 -0.79 ] [ -2.0  2.0 ]
     
                    = [ 1.0 0.25 ] [ -0.25  0.71 ]
                      [ 1.0 0.75 ] [  0.99 -1.38 ]
     
                    = [ 0.0  0.36 ]
                      [ 0.5 -0.33 ]
     
                    which is NOT equal to W_F
     

Test generalization as well, before asymptote is reached.  Test the
the pattern-based network with the input picture (1,0) expressed in
pattern coordinates, and test the feature-based network with the same
input picture expressed in feature coordinates.  Are the outputs
identical in terms of the picture they represent?

**** 
     Picture (1,0) in feature coordinates is [ 1.0 ]
                                             [ 0.0 ]
     
     and yields output [ 0.24 ]
                       [ 0.24 ]
     
     which represents picture (0.24,0.24).
     
     
     Picture (1,0) in pattern coordinates is [  1.5 ]
                                             [ -2.0 ]
     
     and yields output [ -0.25 ]
                       [  0.99 ]
     
     which represents picture (0.0,0.5).  (Computed by multiplying
                                           by P^-1.)
     
     The outputs are NOT identical.


1D. Non-Isomorphism under Local Damage. Now use the asymptotic weight
matrices of the feature-based and pattern-based networks, and suppose
we inflict local damage by excising the first input node from each
network.  Test each damaged network with the input picture (1,1).  Use
the appropriate input coordinates for each network!  Are the outputs
from the two damaged networks equivalent in terms of the picture they
represent?

**** 
     Picture (1,1) in feature coordinates is [ 1.0 ]
                                             [ 1.0 ].
     
     The damaged feature-based network is
     
      W_F = [ 0.0  1.00 ]
            [ 0.0  0.00 ]
     
     and yields output [ 1.0 ]
                       [ 0.0 ]
     
     which represents picture (1.0,0.0).
     
     
     Picture (1,1) in pattern coordinates is [ 1.0 ]
                                             [ 0.0 ].
     
     The damaged pattern-based network is
     
      W_P = [ 0.0  1.25 ]
            [ 0.0 -1.50 ]
     
     and yields output [ 0.0 ]
                       [ 0.0 ]
     
     which represents picture (0.0,0.0).
     
     The outputs are NOT identical.
