Exercises, Week 9: The Delta Rule. Due Tuesday March 21.

<p>The print command in Tlearn is problematic. Instead of using the
Tlearn print command, use screen dumps. In Win95/98/NT, press the
Print_Screen key to put the entire screen into a paste buffer. Then
paste the screen into a Word (or other text processor) using the
Edit->Paste menu in Word. To capture just a single window instead of
the whole screen, highlight (click on) the desired window and then
press ALT-Print_Screen. For Macintosh computers, the key combination
'apple'+shift+4+caps_lock saves a picture of a selected window. Once
saved, double-clicking the file opens the picture in SimpleText, from
which you can either print it or paste it right into a Word doc.
Alternatively, the key combination 'apple'+shift+3 will save a picture
file of the entire screen.


<p><strong>1. XOR problem.</strong> Work through the <tt>tlearn</tt>
example on pp. 117-126.  Once you have understood the example, do the
following: In <em>Training Options</em>, change from "Seed with 5" to
"Seed Randomly."  The seed must be set randomly for the remainder of
this set of exercises.  Now repeatedly train the network (use Cntrl-t
in Windows or Apple-t in Mac), and watch what happens in the <em>Error
Display</em>.  You'll see that on some runs, the network doesn't fully
learn the XOR patterns.

<p><em>1A.</em> For one of the runs in which the network does not
fully learn, print out the <em>Error Display</em> and the
<em>Connection Weights</em> display.  Which pattern has the network
not learned?

<p><em>1B.</em> Now train the network 50 times, and tally the number
of times that the network reduced the error to below 0.100 within 4000
sweeps (report this tally).

<p><em>1C.</em> Now change the architecture so that there are 10
hidden nodes (instead of 2).  Train this network 50 times, and tally
the number of times that the network reduced the error to below 0.100
within 4000 sweeps (report this tally).  At the end of any one of
these runs, print out the <em>Connection Weights</em> display and the
<em>Network Architecture</em> display.  Why does this network learn
the XOR more reliably with 10 hidden nodes than with 2 hidden nodes?

<p><em>1D.</em> Now add a fifth pattern to the training set: input
pattern 0.5,0.5 goes to output 0.5.  You'll need to alter the .data
and .teach files accordingly.  Now train the 10-hidden node network on
this 5-pattern set 50 times. Tally the number of times that the
network reduced the error to below 0.100 within 4000 sweeps (report
this tally).  At the end of any one of these runs, print out the
<em>Connection Weights</em> display.  Now change back to the 2-hidden
node network.  Train this network 50 times on the 5-pattern training
set.  Tally the number of times that the network reduced the error to
below 0.100 within 4000 sweeps (report this tally).  At the end of any
one of these runs, print out the <em>Connection Weights</em> display.
Why can't the 2-node network learn the 5-pattern set?  Why can the
10-node network learn the 5-pattern set?


<p><strong>2. Blocking and Overshadowing.</strong> In preparation for
this exercise, review the exercise on blocking and overshadowing that
you did during the first week of class: <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/hw2intro.html">
Error-driven model for associative learning.</a> <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/hw2results.html">(Summary
of results.)</a>

<p>Your job now is to set up a network in T-learn to simulate the
Rescorla-Wagner model described in the earlier exercise. The model
architecture should like this:

<br><img align=center 
src="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/hw2network.gif">

<br> Notice that there is no bias node, and no hidden layer.  Notice
also that the output nodes are linear, not sigmoidal.


<p>The model should be trained in two phases, just as you were trained
in the learning phase of the first-week exercise.  The first phase
should have 18 cases of each pattern pair (i.e., 18 cases of stiff
neck -> A; and, 18 cases of dizziness -> B), and the second phase
should have 18 cases of each pattern pair (i.e., 18 cases of stiff
neck and pallid skin -> A; and, 18 cases of itchy toes and double
vision -> B).

<p>Initialize the network with weights of zero. Train your network
with a learning rate of 0.05 and a momentum of zero. Train the
patterns in random order within each phase (of course the two phases
should be done sequentially, with weights retained from one phase to
the next). 

<p>Print out your .cf, .data, and .teach files. Print out the
architecture display and the weights display at the end of training.
Annotate these print outs to briefly explain what each is.

<p>Test the network with the same test cases as in the first-week
exercise.  Does the network show good performance on the training
items?  Does the network show blocking?  Does the network show
overshadowing?  Include relevant print-outs that have the answers to
these questions, and annotate the print outs to explain what question
each answers.

<p><strong>Extensive notes, including diagrams of <em>T-learn</em> set
up for this exercise, are available on <a
