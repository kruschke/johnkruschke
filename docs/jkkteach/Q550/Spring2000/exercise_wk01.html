<h2>
Exercises, Week 1, Due Tuesday January **, 2001.

<p>Please do the four activities linked below.  Each activity involves
first participating as a subject in a brief, on-line experiment.  Then
you examine your data and investigate to what extent a simple model
fits your data.  Average results from a large number of participants
are linked next to each activity below.  These average results may
help clarify the empirical phenomena being modeled, after you have
gone through the experiment yourself.

<p>You will find that the activities have page titles referring to
"P335 Cognitive Psychology" instead of "Q550 Models in Cognitive
Science."  This is because I originally developed the activities for
my undergraduate cognitive psychology course.  Despite the difference
in course number, the four activities serve as an excellent
introduction to the more advanced modeling we explore in Q550.  You
will also find that the titles on the activities refer to "Homework
1," "Homework 2," etc.  Please just ignore these numbers (they refer
only to P335, not to Q550), and do the activities in the order listed
below.

<p>The activities also ask you to complete an evaluation form.  This
evaluation is <em>not</em> required for Q550, and you do not get extra
points for doing an evaluation.  You are, however, invited to do the
evaluations anyway, because I am always interested in making the
activities better.
