<dd>On the <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/q550_bbs/q550.cgi"> web
discussion page </a> you'll find a message entitled "Homework Week 5:
Recurrent Processing."  For 3 pts., <em>reply</em> to that message
(include your name as it appears on the roster but do <em>not</em>
post your student ID number).  For up to 7 more pts., briefly address
this question: <blockquote>Chapter 9 concerned itself with two types
of models: sequential search and parallel search.  Both these types of
models are <em>feed forward</em>, in that processing stages only
affect <em>subsequent</em> stages, and never affect stages that came
before.  Contemplate models in which processes can <em>feed back</em>
to earlier processes (or to themselves).  Could this kind of recurrent
processing model address data of Figure 9.7 (p. 394)?</blockquote> I'm
looking for thoughtful discussion, not necessarily fully expressed
formalizations fit to data!  You are welcome to reply more than once,
and to reply to other students' postings.
