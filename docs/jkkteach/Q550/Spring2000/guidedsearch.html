<h2>
Example of Guided Search Model
</h2>

</center>


<p>Consider displays consisting of uppercase or lowercase X's or O's.
Here is one example of such a display, with just three items:

<pre>
  +----------+
  |          |
  |    o     |
  |          |
  |  x       |
  |      X   |
  |          |
  +----------+
</pre>

<p>We want to determine the salience of each item, according to the
guided search model.  To do this, we need to specify more info:

<ul>

<li>Suppose that the target being searched for is an uppercase X.
(This happens to be a feature search for this display, because there
is only one uppercase item in the display.)

<li>Suppose that the two scale values for shape are f<sub>x</sub>=1 and
f<sub>o</sub>=3.  

<li>Suppose that the two scale values for size are
f<sub>lowercase</sub>=6 and f<sub>uppercase</sub>=7.

<li>Suppose that the target dissimilarity has a weights of 
d<sub>shape</sub>=.5 and d<sub>case</sub>=.7

</ul>

<p>The salience of the lowercase o is:
<pre>
            o vs. x   o vs. X          o vs. target
            -------   -------          ------------
  exp( 1/2 [ |3-1|  +  |3-1|  ] ) - .5    |3-1|
              o x       o X                o X
+ exp( 1/2 [ |6-6|  +  |6-7|  ] ) - .7    |6-7| 

= exp(2.0) -.5*2 + exp(0.5) -.7*1

= 7.34 
</pre>

<p>The salience of the lowercase x is:
<pre>
            x vs. o   x vs. X          x vs. target
            -------   -------          ------------
  exp( 1/2 [ |1-3|  +  |1-1|  ] ) - .5    |1-1|
              x o       x X                x X
+ exp( 1/2 [ |6-6|  +  |6-7|  ] ) - .7    |6-7| 

= exp(1.0) -.5*0 + exp(0.5) -.7*1

= 3.67
</pre>



<p>The salience of the uppercase X is:
<pre>
            X vs. o   X vs. x          X vs. target
            -------   -------          ------------
  exp( 1/2 [ |1-3|  +  |1-1|  ] ) - .5    |1-1|
              X o       X x                X X
+ exp( 1/2 [ |7-6|  +  |7-6|  ] ) - .7    |7-7| 

= exp(1.0) -.5*0 + exp(1.0) -.7*0

= 5.44
</pre>

<p>So, with these parameter values, the "o" is most salient, the "X"
is next most salient, and the "x" is least salient.  Without any noise
in the saliences, the guided search model would always search the
items in this order; hence, it would find the target (X) at the second
item checked.

<p>But the full guided search model adds noise to the saliences.  Just
how long it will take to find the target then depends also on how
salient distractors are.  For example, in this case, the target has a
salience of 5.44 and the distractor "o" has a salience of 7.34, a
salience difference of 1.90.  If there is enough noise added, then
maybe the target item will end up having a little more salience than
the distractor.  Such an inversion of saliences due to noise can
happen more easily when the salience differences are small.
