<h3>Newton's vague idea (the proverbial apple on the noggin):</h3>

<p align=justify>There is an unseen force of gravity that affects all objects,
whether they are apples a few feet away or planetary satellites many
miles away.  This force brings about observable movements in the
objects.  This force acts instantaneously and across any medium for
infinite extent.  The force is greater for larger objects, and the
force diminishes with distance.  (Pretty bizarre idea, isn't it?  You
can read <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~gravitee/principia.htm">

<h3>Newton's precise formalizations:</h3>

<strong>2nd Law of Motion:</strong> &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<center><em> a = F / m </em></center>
<br>Something observable, viz. acceleration <em>a</em> 
(actually position and time
are observable), is related to unobservable constructs, viz. force <em>F</em> 
and mass <em>m</em>.
<p>
<strong>Law of Universal Gravitation:</strong>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<center><em> F = G m<sub>1</sub> m<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup> </em></center>
<br>The force due to gravity between two objects is proportional to the masses of the objects, and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects.
<ul>
<li>applies to particles <li>applies independently (additively) to all
particles simultaneously <li><em>G</em> is a parameter, estimated from observed
data.  It turns out that <em>G</em> is essentially the same for all known
locations and situations in the universe.
</ul>

<h3>A simple prediction of the theory:</h3>

<p align=justify>
For a small object of mass <em>m<sub>o</sub></em> near the surface of
the earth, the object's acceleration <em>a</em> is given by:
<center>
<em>
m<sub>o</sub> a = F = G m<sub>o</sub> m<sub>e</sub> / r<sup>2</sup><sub>e</sub>
</em>
</center>
where <em>m<sub>e</sub></em> is the mass of the earth, and
<em>r<sub>e</sub></em> is the distance between the center of the earth
and center of the small object.  (We assume that the gravitational
influence of a sphere, such as the earth, can be treated as if all the
mass were concentrated at a single point at its center.  This
assumption was proven by Newton using integral calculus, which he
invented [as did Leibnitz].  We also assume that the distance
travelled by the falling object is negligible compared with the
distance between the center of the earth and the object, so we treat
<em>r<sub>e</sub></em> as a constant.)  Rearranging the equation leads to
<center>
<em>
a = G m<sub>e</sub> / r<sup>2</sup><sub>e</sub>
</em>
</center>
Notice that this is a constant, called <em>g</em>.  That is, the
acceleration of a falling object is independent of its mass.  See the
photo at right for verification of this prediction.
</p>

<p>
<h3>A related prediction:</h3>

<p>
Because acceleration is constant <em>g</em> (for small distances near
the surface of the earth), we can integrate to find the equation for
the position of the object as it falls:

<center>
<em> 
<br>
a = d<sup>2</sup>y/dt<sup>2</sup> = g
<br>
dy/dt = g t
<br>
y = 0.5 g t<sup>2</sup> 
</em>
</center>

<p>(In these integrations I have left out the constants that represent
the initial velocity and position.)  So, with constant increments in
time, the distance fallen should be proportional to time squared, i.e.,
0, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.  Galileo had, a few decades before, already
observed this with objects rolling down an inclined plane.  He noted
that the distance travelled, during consecutive time intervals,
increased by a constant: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., just as Newton's laws
predict.  (Newton was born the year that Galileo died.)

<p>
<h3>Models, in general, of the physical world:</h3>

<p>In general, models of the physical world try to describe changes in
observable physical attributes in terms of unseen physical components
that cause the changes.  Newton's theory of gravity explains changes
in position with time (the observables) in terms of gravity and mass
(which are not directly observable).  

<p>Models in science are replete with constructs that represent unseen
physical entities: In physics there are electrical forces, magnetic
forces, nuclear forces, etc.  In chemistry there are electron orbitals,
with shells and subshells.  In biology there are germs that carry
disease and genes that carry inherited traits (both unobservable when
first proposed).

<p>Models go beyond vague ideas about hidden constructs. Models
<em>formalize</em> the ideas.  Formalization has several attractive
qualities: First, it makes the idea publically accessible.  When an
idea is only a vague intuition in the mind of the theorist, then the
only way to really know what the theory predicts is to ask the
theorist.  When the model is formalized, then anyone can determine
what the theory predicts.  The predictions might be derivable from
analytical mathematical methods, or they might only be derivable from
computer simulations.  Second, formalization makes the theory
precise. The predictions are quantitative and specific, so that the
theory might actually be tested.  And, if the theory holds up, then
its predictions are quantitatively useful.

<p>When a theory works extremely accurately in a wide variety of
situations, then people start to believe that the formal constructs in
the model represent actual hidden entities in the world.  Because
Newton's theory of gravity has worked so remarkably well, people
actually began to think that there was an unseen force that acted
instantaneously at all distances through all materials, pulling comets
to the sun and knees to the ground.  The concept of gravity has become
part of our cultural intuition about the physical world.  So when
Einstein came along and obviated gravity, replacing it with geodesics
in space-time, these new formal constructs were a "revolution."  No
circumspect scientist reifies theoretical constructs, regardless of
how well they fit observations.  The theoretical constructs are always
just a metaphorical description.  But this does not mean that they are
trivial or frivolous.  Good theories are, ultimately, widely useful
for applications, and also deeply edifying for the explanatory
perspective they yield.

<h3>Models, in general, of the <em>cognitive</em> world:</h3>

<p>Modeling in cognitive science has essentially the same structure as
modeling in physical science.  All that differs is the selection of
physical attributes and processes that are deemed interesting.  Those
physical attributes of the world that seem relevant for explaining
cognition are called "stimuli," and those physical attributes of the
world that seem relevant as indicators of cognition are called
"behavior" or "responses."

<p>Models in cognitive science specify formal descriptions of the
incoming stimuli, the outgoing behavior, and the intermediate
transformed states.  These formal descriptions are called
<em>representations</em>.  A representation explicitly describes
particular <em>contents</em> in a particular <em>format</em>.  For
example, a phone book represents particular contents about people,
--their phone number, address, and name-- in a particular format
--alphabetical by last name.  Models in cognitive science also specify
formal descriptions of transformations on these representations.  Such
formal transformations are called <em>processes</em>.  

<p>Any model in cognitive science specifies representation and
process.  But (and here's the news) so does any model in physical
science.  For example, Newton's model of gravity specifies certain
representations of the world --position, time, mass, force-- and
certain processes that transform positions at one time into new
positions at a later time --multiplicative combination of masses and
distances.  Thus, represenation and process <em>are in the model</em>,
whether the model refers to the locations of particles or to the
behavior of cognizant beings.

<p>Just as physicists can begin to believe that the representations
and processes in a successful model actually exist in the world,
cognitive scientists can begin to believe that the representations and
processes in a successful model actually exist in the mind. I believe
that such reification of models is a mistake.  There is a lot of
philosophical controversy about whether or not the mind actually has
representations and processes, and exactly what these terms mean in
this context, and whether or not artificial cognition can really be
created by copying the representations and processes on other
hardware.  I believe that such issues can remain unresolved while
significant progress is made in models or cognition, just as
significant progress has been made in physics despite philosophical
uncertainty about whether or not a force of gravity really exists.

<p>
<h3>Summary of the main points:</h3>
<ul>

<li>Formal models are specifications of (more vague) explanatory
theories.

<li>Models posit formal constructs that reflect hidden processes and
explanatory principles.

<li>Models in the physical sciences and in the cognitive sciences have
essentially the same (meta-)structure.  They both specify formal
representations and processes.

<li>Reification of formal constructs can lead to unresolvable
philosophical conundrums.
