<p><strong>Spring 2003:</strong> Unlike previous renditions of this
course, Q550 is now supposed to be a "capstone" course that integrates
Q530 (programming methods) and Q560 (empirical methods) with cognitive
modeling. (Links to the previous version of this course appear at the
bottom of this page.)

<p><em>Pre-requisites:</em> Students should have previously taken Q530
(programming methods) and Q560 (empirical methods), or have equivalent
experience and knowledge. This means (1) having some experience with
programming computers in some language - we'll be using MATLAB and
SPSS, which you can learn quickly if you have previous computer
programming experience, and (2) having some experience with or
exposure to collecting and analyzing data from biologically animate
cognitive organisms such as humans. If you don't have much experience
with these methods, take the course at your own risk!

<p><em>Goals:</em> Students will get experience doing four things:
<ol>
<li>Design and run a simple experiment relevant to their research interests.
<li>Analyze the data using standard inferential statistics.
<li>Program a simple cognitive process model for the experiment task.
<li>Fit the model to the data.
</ol>

<p><em>Approximate schedule and topics:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Complete example of doing four things above, from
literature.</em> (2 weeks) <li><em>Complete example of doing four
things above, hands-on, for a "canned" experiment and model.</em> (2
weeks) <li><em>Design and execute student's own experiment.</em>
Should be a simple experiment replicating an established effect, for
educating the rest of the class. Experiment can be implemented in
PowerPoint, paper and pencil, Matlab, etc. Classmates will serve as
participants. (4 weeks) <li><em>Analyze own data.</em> (2 weeks)
<li><em>Program own model.</em> Should be a simple model reflecting
established theories in the literature, for educating the rest of the
class. "Simple" means, in particular, having only a few free
parameters. We'll use Matlab. (3 weeks). <li><em>Fit model to
data.</em> (1 week) <li><em>Present project to class.</em> This will
be done in stages as the class progress, not as a final. </ul>

<p>Readings and materials: Collected chapters, articles; no main
textbook. The main computer software will be Matlab; possibly also
SPSS.

<h2>MatLab resources:</h2>

MatLab is available on all I.U. public computers <em>except</em> Apple
Macintoshes.

<p>If you want to install it on your own machine, I.U. students can
buy an annual lease through the StatMath Center, or buy directly from
MatLab. The Student Version release 13 costs $99 direct from MathWorks
(the manufacturer of MatLab), and toolboxes typically cost $59 each.

<p>The I.U. machines also have many MatLab Toolboxes installed,
including the Statistics Toolbox, the Optimization Toolbox, the Neural
Network Toolbox, and others. The toolbox for running experiments via
MatLab is available separately; see the link below.

<p>The format of Q550 for Spring 2003 is different than previous
renditions of Q550. The pages linked below are from the previous
version (2001), so do not read them if you want to know about the
upcoming version. But the old version was golden, so take a look for
nostalgia's sake.
