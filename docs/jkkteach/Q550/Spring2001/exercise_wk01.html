<p>Please do the four activities in the <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/model_exercises/">linked web
page</a>.  Each activity involves first participating as a subject in
a brief, on-line experiment.  Then you examine your data and
investigate to what extent a simple model fits your data.  Average
results from a large number of participants are linked with each
activity.  These average results may help clarify the empirical
phenomena being modeled, after you have gone through the experiment
yourself.
