<p><strong>Course Description and Goals:</strong> This course is an
introduction to models in cognitive science.  The course begins by
briefly considering non-cognitive scientific models, such as Newton's
model of gravity. This will give us our first example of a parameter
in a model (the gravitational constant) and hypothesized but hidden
representations and processes (mass and gravity). We then turn our
attention to empirical phenomena in cognitive science - such as
perception, categorization, and decision making - and consider simple
phenomena and models of each. This will provide our first taste of
model construction and model fitting in cognitive science. Upon this
foundation, we will then read several chapters that give in-depth
descriptions of well established models in cognitive science. With
these rigorous examples of models as standards, we will then evaluate
a number of connectionist models of cognitive phenomena.  The course
will conclude by briefly considering the limit of behavior that is
deemed to be cognitive; e.g., in insects, and the ways in which
(models of) cognitive processing might differ from (models of)
mechanical processing.

<p>One goal of the course is to show how models in cognitive science
are as essential as models in physical science, and to show that
models play a similar role in both cognitive and physical sciences.

<p>A second goal of the course is to selectively survey contemporary
models in cognitive science.  The survey emphasizes models that make a
serious attempt to account for detailed aspects of human behavior.

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 

<ul>

<p><li><em>Mathematics:</em> Some knowledge of calculus is definitely
helpful, but not critical for getting through the course.

<p><li><em>Cognitive Science:</em> Some background in cognitive
science (e.g., Q500) is also very helpful, but again not required.

<p><li><em>Computer Programming:</em> No actual programming is
required.  We will be using pre-packaged programs.  You will, however,
need to edit and manipulate computer files on a PC-type computer (as
opposed to Macintosh or Unix computers).

<p><li><em>Time Commitment:</em> The course covers a lot of territory
in a hurry.  To get the most out of this course, be prepared to devote
some time to it.

<p><strong>Required Textbooks:</strong> 


<p><IMG SRC="scarboroughcover.jpg" align=right>1. Scarborough and
Sternberg (eds.), 1998. <em>An Invitation to Cognitive Science - 2nd
Edition: Vol.  4: Methods, Models, and Conceptual
Issues</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

<p><strong>Computers:</strong> We will be making extensive use
of the campus computers.  

<ul>

<li><em>Network ID:</em> If you have not already done so,
please activate your IU computer accounts immediately.  To do so, take
a photo ID to 084 IMU.  Even if you already have your accounts
activated, it can help to make sure you have a <a

network ID</a>.

<p><li><em>World Wide Web:</em> We will use the World Wide Web
for posting announcements, homework assignments, and discussion.  Our
class home page is

                                 upper case "Q"
</pre>

<p><li><em>Software:</em> We will be using the <tt>tlearn</tt>
connectionist simulator supplied with the connectionism book.  It
should be used with Windows95/98. It supposedly can work with Mac's
and Unix, but previous attempts have led to frustration.

</ul>

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> There is homework assigned every week,
as indicated on the course <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>.

<p><strong>Class Format:</strong> There will be a mix of lecture with
discussion.  For discussions to be useful, you will need to come well
prepared.

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Grades are based mostly on
performance on the homework assignments, with additional benefits for
thoughtful and frequent participation in class discussions. Grading is
"on a curve" insofar as individual grades are assigned relative to the
central tendency of all students in the course, but there is no preset
shape of the grade distribution.  As this is a graduate course, most
grades will probably be A's or B's, with C's (or lower) assigned only
rarely.

<p><strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes, nor copies
of overhead projector slides, are available.  If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and then please see Prof.
Kruschke or the assistant if you have questions.

<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> A <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a> is shown on a separate page.</a>
