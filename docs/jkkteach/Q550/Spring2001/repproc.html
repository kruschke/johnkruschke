<h2> 
Representation and Process: Some Examples.
</h2>
</center>

<p> We infer what happens inside the mind by observing the stimuli
that go in and the responses that come out:
<center><table>
<tr>
<td><em>Stimulus</em></td>
<td>--></td>
<td><table border=1 cellpadding=10><tr><td align=center>
<font size=+1><strong>?</strong>
</font></td></tr></table></td>
<td>--></td>
<td><em>Response</em></td>
</tr>
</table></center>
When we <em>explain</em> what is happening inside the mind with a
theory, the theory must specify what information is being used and how
it is being used.  The specification of the content of the
information, and its format, is called the <em>representation</em>
assumed by the theory. The specification of how the information is
used is called the <em>process</em> assumed by the theory.  The
explanation does not necessarily claim that the representation and
process are really in the mind; instead, the explanation claims that
whatever the mind is doing, a good description of it is in terms of
this representation and process.

<p>Below are two examples of everyday activities for which the
representations and processes are (at least partially) outside the
head.  Because they are external, we can get a better sense of just
what is meant by these terms, "representation" and "process."

<h3>
Example 1: Explain how you look up a phone number.
</h3>

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td align=center><em>Stimulus:</em> <br>The desired person's name.</td>
<td valign=center>--></td>
<td><table border=1 cellpadding=10><tr><td align=center><font size=+1><strong>?</strong></font></td></tr></table></td>
<td valign=center>--></td>
<td align=center><em>Response:</em> <br>His or her phone number.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 width=100%>
<tr>
<td width=16%></td>
<td align=center width=42%><strong>Theory 1</strong></td>
<td align=center width=42%><strong>Theory 2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Representation</strong></td>
<td>
<em>Content:</em> Names and numbers.
<br><em>Format:</em> Alphabetically ordered list.
</td>
<td>
<em>Content:</em> Names and numbers.
<br><em>Format:</em> List in order of frequency of use.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Process</strong></td>
<td>Move through list alphabetically until name is found, then retrieve corresponding number.</td>
<td>Start looking at the beginning of the list, check each name as you go.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The physical implementation of the information is irrelevant to the
explanation; the phone "book" could be bound paper, clay tablets,
CD-ROM, or anything else.

<p>You probably have several phone numbers memorized. Do you believe
that either of these theories is a good description of how your mind
remembers phone numbers?

<h3>
Example 2: Explain how you add two numbers
</h3>

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td align=center><em>Stimulus:</em> <br>Two numbers.</td>
<td valign=center>--></td>
<td><table border=1 cellpadding=10><tr><td align=center><font size=+1><strong>?</strong></font></td></tr></table></td>
<td valign=center>--></td>
<td align=center><em>Response:</em> <br>Their sum.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 width=100%>
<tr>
<td width=16%></td>
<td align=center width=42%><strong>Theory 1</strong></td>
<td align=center width=42%><strong>Theory 2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Representation</strong></td>
<td>
Roman numerals.
<br><em>Content:</em> Symbols such as M, D, C, L, X, V, I.
<br><em>Format:</em> Usually larger to smaller, with inversions as
shorthand (e.g., LIX is shorthand for LVIIII).
</td>
<td>
Binary (base 2).
<br><em>Content:</em> Just two symbols: 0 and 1.
<br><em>Format:</em> Place system: separate columns for 
2<sup>3</sup>,
2<sup>2</sup>, 
2<sup>1</sup>, 
2<sup>0</sup>, etc., from larger to smaller.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Process</strong></td>
<td>Lots of memorization of many miscellaneous combinations.</td>
<td>Memorize just four facts (0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1=0&nbsp;carry&nbsp;1); 
use place system with carries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td align=center>IX + V = XIV</td>
<td align=center>
<table>
<tr><td align=right><tt>1001</tt></td>
<tr><td align=right><tt>+&nbsp;&nbsp;101</tt></td>
<tr><td align=right><tt><hr></tt></td>
<tr><td align=right><tt>1110</tt></td>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The physical implementation of the information is irrelevant to the
explanation; the symbol manipulations could be done on clay tablets,
on papyrus, or in silicon chips.

<p>When you add numbers "in your head" do you think that either of
these theories is a good description of what your mind is doing?
