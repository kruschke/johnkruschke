<p><dt>And this:

<dd> Chapter 9 concerned itself with two types of models: sequential
search and parallel search.  Both these types of models are <em>feed
forward</em>, in that processing stages only affect
<em>subsequent</em> stages, and never affect stages that came
before. Moreover, the parallel models assume independence between
parallel stages, such that what is happening in one stage cannot
affect what is happening in a parallel stage.  Contemplate models in
which processes can <em>feed back</em> to earlier processes (or to
themselves), or <em>cross talk</em> between parallel processes.  Could
this kind of recurrent or lateral processing model address data of
Figure 9.7 (p. 394)? I'm looking for thoughtful discussion, not
necessarily fully expressed formalizations fit to data!
