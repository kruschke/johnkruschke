<p><strong>Category specific impairments: Replication of Farah and
McClelland (1991).</strong> For this exercise, we'll set up an
autoassociative network like the one described on pages 255-260.
The "project name" for <tt>tlearn</tt> will be "fm91".


<p>Below is the network's configuration file.  Nodes 1-24 are the
verbal input, nodes 25-48 are the visual input, nodes 49-68 represent
functional semantics, and nodes 69-128 represent visual semantics.
Nodes 129-256 are just copies of nodes 1-128, respectively, from the
previous time step.  Compare the specifications in the file, below,
with the architecture shown in Figure 11.6 (p. 257) of the textbook.

<p><strong><a href="fm91/fm91.cf">fm91.cf</a></strong>:
<pre>
NODES:
nodes = 256
inputs = 128
outputs = 128
output nodes are 1-128
CONNECTIONS:
groups = 0
1-128 from i1-i128 = 1. & 1. fixed one-to-one
129-256 from 1-128 = 1. & 1. fixed one-to-one
1-48 from 177-256
49-128 from 129-176
SPECIAL:
linear = 129-256
bipolar = 1-128
selected = 1-48
weight_limit = 0.0001
</pre>

<p>We'll train the network with just three "living" patterns and three
"non-living" patterns, unlike the original simulation, which used ten
of each.  We cycle each pattern 10 times, to let the activations
settle.  Hence the training files contain (3+3)x10=60 rows.  The
<tt>.reset</tt> files are very important: They reset the network
activations at the beginning of each pattern's set of 10 cycles.

<p><strong>Training pattern files:</strong>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91.data">fm91.data</a>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91.teach">fm91.teach</a>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91.reset">fm91.reset</a>

<p>Train the network with the <tt>fm91.*</tt> files, using the
following parameter values: Train for 600 sweeps, with a learning rate
of 0.15, momentum of zero, bias offset of zero, seed randomly, log
error every 60 sweeps, train sequentially (not randomly!), do not dump
weights, use and log RMS error, update weights every 1 sweep, and use
reset file.  Let me emphasize that last setting: Be sure that the "Use
reset file" box is checked.

<p><em>Closely examine the training patterns in <tt>fm91.data</tt>.
How can you determine which of the six distinct patterns are living
things, and which are nonliving things?  For these patterns, how many
functional semantic features are non-zero for living things?  How many
functional semantic features are non-zero for nonliving things?  How
many visual semantic features are non-zero for living things?  How
many visual semantic features are non-zero for nonliving things?</em>

<p><em>Train the network and show a plot of error as a function of
training sweep.</em>

<p>Now test the network, using the most recent weights.  Make sure
that "calculate error" is checked, and make sure that "use reset file"
is checked.  No need to log error, and no need to send output to
window or to append output to a file.

<p><em>Test the network on the training set, on the picture
generalization set (below), and on the name generalization set (also
below). Show the three plots of error as a function of pattern.  In
your plots, mark which patterns correspond to living things, and which
patterns correspond to non-living things.</em>

<p><strong>Picture generalization pattern files:</strong>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91picgen.data">fm91picgen.data</a>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91picgen.teach">fm91picgen.teach</a>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91picgen.reset">fm91picgen.reset</a>

<p><strong>Name generalization pattern files:</strong>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91namgen.data">fm91namgen.data</a>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91namgen.teach">fm91namgen.teach</a>
<br><a href="fm91/fm91namgen.reset">fm91namgen.reset</a>

<p>Now lesion the network.  Beware!  The lesioning utility does not
work properly in the PC version, and might not work properly in the
Mac version either.  So proceed with caution: Read all these
instructions before actually executing any of them.  Under the
"Special" menu, click on lesioning.  In the dialogue box, double click
in the "weight file" box and then select <tt>fm91-600.wts</tt>. Check
the NODES box, and remove 99 percent of nodes 49-68 (for a functional
semantic lesion) or nodes 69-128 (for a visual semantic lesion). If
you are using a PC, and maybe if you are using a Mac, when you click
OK, an output window will then pop-up and begin spewing forth all the
new, lesioned weights.  This screen dump not only takes forever
(several minutes), it is also full of contaminated non-ascii
characters.  So, here's what to do to salvage the lesioning (at least
on a PC): While the screen dump is happening, press
[cntrl]-[alt]-[delete].  In Windows95/98, this interrupts the process
and asks if you really want to kill <tt>tlearn</tt>.  Click "Yes"!
(That's satisfying, isn't it?) Now, explore the tlearn directory you
were working in, and you should find a file called <tt>les_tmp</tt>.
This file has the correctly lesioned weights in it, so rename it
something like fm91-vis-lsn.wts or fm91-sem-lsn.wts (depending on
which nodes you lesioned).  Repeat this process a second time to
lesion the other nodes: Re-invoke tlearn, load the fm91 project,
<em>and use the old weights, <tt>fm91-600.wts</tt></em>.  That is,
don't retrain the network; use the results of training from the first
time, and just lesion the weights differently.  (If you use a PC and
you cannot get the lesioning to work, you might try grabbing this
zipped file of trained and lesioned weights: <a
href="fm91/fm91wts_arch.zip">fm91wts_arch.zip</a>.)

<p><em>Now test the training patterns and both sets of generalization
patterns for both kinds of lesions.  Show plots of error (six plots in
all; i.e., two sets of lesioned weights, times three pattern sets).
Label the living and nonliving patterns in each plot.  For each type
of lesion, is the error on the living patterns more or less than the
error on the nonliving patterns?  Does this correspond to the results
of Farah and McClelland? (Compare with Figure 11.7, p. 258.)
