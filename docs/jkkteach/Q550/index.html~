<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Professor John K. Kruschke, e-mail:
kruschke@indiana.edu, voice: 855-3192, office: 336 Psychology, hours:
W 2:30-3:30 and by appointment. Web page: <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/">http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/</a>

<p><strong>Class web page:</strong> This syllabus and all related
class info are posted at <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/">http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/</a>. It
will be frequently updated, so reload it every time you check it.

<p><strong>Course content:</strong> As of Spring 2003, Q550 is
intended to be a "capstone" course that integrates Q530 (programming
methods) and Q560 (empirical methods) with cognitive modeling. The
course is also intended to be a "hands on" experience for students to
actually do some modeling, not just read about it.

<blockquote>
<small>The current format and content of Q550 is very different than previous
renditions of Q550. Old versions were golden:
<br>
<li><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/Spring2001/">Spring
2001</a> (and previous since 1997). A survey of models in cognitive
science.  <br><li><a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/Q550/Spring1997/">Spring
1997</a> (and previous since 1990). A course covering exclusively
<em>connectionist</em> networks.  </small></blockquote>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Students should have previously
taken Q530 (programming methods) and Q560 (empirical methods), or have
equivalent experience and knowledge. We will be using the programming
language MATLAB, which you can learn quickly if you have previous
computer programming experience. You should also have some experience
with collecting and analyzing data from biologically animate cognitive
organisms such as humans. If you don't have much experience with these
programming and empirical methods, take this course at your own risk!

<p><strong>Exemptions:</strong> If you already have extensive
experience in conducting experiments, analyzing data, and especially
fitting models, then the instructor will consider granting you an
exemption from the course. That means you will have satisfied the
course requirement for Cognitive Science, but you do not get credit
hours. Please contact the instructor if you believe that you may
qualify for an exemption.

<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Along with gaining understanding of
concepts of modeling, students will get experience doing four things:
<ol>
<li>Designing and running a simple experiment relevant to their
research interests.  <li>Analyzing the data using standard inferential
statistics.  <li>Programming a simple cognitive process model for the
experiment task.  <li>Fitting the model to the data.
</ol>

<p><strong>Readings and materials:</strong> No required
textbook. Selected articles online. MatLab documentation online. See
links below.

<p><strong>Web bulletin board:</strong> Announcements and discussion
will appear frequently on the web bulletin board in <a
href="https://oncourse.iu.edu/"> Oncourse</a>.

<p><strong>Grading:</strong> There will be various homework
assignments throughout the course. Students will also make brief
presentations describing their projects. A final poster and paper are
also required. There will be no exams, but the final exam period will
be devoted to a poster presentation session. The individual project
will count for one half of the grade; the preceding homework
assignments will count for one half of the grade.

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Any information provided here is
subject to change. Changes will be announced in class.

<li><a href="IndividualProjects.html">Follow this link for details and
suggestions regarding individual projects.</a>

<li>Each student selects a topic of <em>personal interest</em>, and
proposes a <em>simple</em> experiment and <em>simple</em> model for
programming in MatLab. Students are encouraged to base their proposals
on existing published research. The experiment must be short enough
that it can be completed by a participant in 15 minutes. The model
must be simple enough that the student can clearly explain it to the
class and be confident that it is accurately programmed in MatLab. The
model should also have a clear interpretation in terms of cognitive
processes; purely "descriptive" models do not qualify. The proposal
must be approved by the instructor <em>An example of all this is the
N. H. Anderson work studied in the previous section of the
course.</em>

<li>Each student programs his/her experiment in MatLab, and other
students are participants. Ethical treatment of participants will be
emphasized.

<li>Each student conducts a statistical analysis of the effects of
interest in his/her data.

<li>Each student programs the corresponding model, and fits the model
to his/her data.

<li>Periodic progress reports are submitted and presented in class,
and a final report.  The final exam period will be devoted to a poster
session in which students display their project.

<h2>MatLab resources:</h2>

We will be using the computer software called "MATLAB" quite
extensively, for programming models, experiments, and data analysis.

<p><em>Where to find it</em>: MatLab and many accompanying "Toolboxes"
are available on all I.U. public computers <em>except</em> Apple
Macintoshes. If you want to install MatLab on your own machine,
I.U. students can buy an annual lease through the StatMath Center, or
buy a personal copy directly from <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks (the manufacturer of
MatLab)</a>.

<p>This is also a free Matlab-alike program called <a
href="http://www.octave.org/" target="new">Octave</a>. It is supposed
to match Matlab's syntax and functionality. It is not, however, as
extensive as Matlab, and is not guaranteed to be fully compatible. So
use Octave at your own risk. I require that all projects turned in
--especially experiments that are distributed to all class members--
have been fully tested in Matlab itself.


<p>For programming experimients, you might consider using the <a
href="http://psychtoolbox.org/">Psychophysics Toolbox for MatLab by
Brainard and Pelli.</a> It is free. I have not yet used it myself.
