<ul>

<p><li>
Utterances are inherently ambiguous.

<p><li>
Normal people automatically integrate
multiple sources of information, and
apply background knowledge, to
spontaneously infer unstated meaning.

<p><li>
Usually the inferred meaning is intended and true.
Thus, normal cognition is usually highly efficacious.

<p><li>
When the inferred meaning is not intended,
it can be humorous, or it can cause fights.

<p><li>
When the inferred meaning is intended but false,
then it's probably an advertisement
or political rhetoric.
