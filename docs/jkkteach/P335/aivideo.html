<dt><strong>Introduction:</strong><dd>
How are humans different from computers?
Are computers different from other machines?
Can a computer think?

<p>
<dt><strong><em>For</em> the possibility of Artificial Intelligence
(AI):</strong><dd>

<p>
<em>Computer metaphor and analogy to flight:</em> We don't need
flapping wings to fly, so we don't need a human brain (nor even human
software) to think.

<p>
<em>Early successes:</em>
e.g., play checkers, solve integrals with 100 heuristics.


<p>
<dt><strong><em>Against</em> the possibility of AI:</strong><dd>
<em>Challenging problems:</em>
Perception;
movement and navigation;
common sense;
language use (Turing test).


<p>
<dt><strong>Early solutions: microworlds and expert systems:</strong><dd>
e.g., ELIZA (computer therapist),
SHRDLU (blocks world language comprehender),
DENDRAL (chemical analysis by expert system).<br>
<em>Problems:</em> Brittleness and lack of common sense.


<p>
<dt><strong>Contemporary approaches to "common sense:"</strong>

<p>
<dd>
<em>1. Huge factual (propositional) database.</em>
e.g., scripts and frames; the CYC project.
<br><em>Problem:</em> Where does general background knowledge get put?

<p>
<em>2. Thousands of embodied experiences.</em>
<br><em>Problem:</em> There is a case of a patient with no motor abilities
who nevertheless has common sense.

<p><em>3. Common sense requires a brain (after all).</em>
e.g., neural network models (such as NETtalk, driving a van)
<br><em>Problems:</em> generalization, representation, scaling up,
and modular organization.


<p>
<dt><strong>Conclusion:</strong><dd>
Still open! Waiting for results from CYC, robotics, neural networks.
