<br>Feature integration requires attention.</font>

<p>Here is the first set of cards that you chose from:

<p><img src="cards1.gif" width="433" height="99"></p>

<p>And here is the second set of cards you were shown:

<p><img src="cards2.gif" width="362" height="99"></p>

<p>Notice that not only is <em>your</em> card missing,
<br>but <em>all</em> the original cards are missing.

<p>What's interesting is that most people do not 
<br>notice that all the cards are missing.
<br>Instead. people only notice that 
<br>the card they <em>attended to</em> is missing.
<br>People only remember the suit-value <em>combination</em>
<br>of a card they <em>attended</em> to.
<br>People don't attend to the other cards, 
<br>and so don't remember the other suit-value combinations.
<br>Therefore people don't notice when all the cards
<br>have changed.
