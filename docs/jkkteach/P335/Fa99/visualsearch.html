<h2>Homework 1: Visual Search</h2>
<br><a href="hw1disc.html">NEW: Q & A about this homework.</a>
</center>

<p> <strong>Introduction.</strong> Imagine you have entered football
stadium, just before gametime.  The seats are mostly full, and you
need to find your friends who have already arrived.  They might be
anywhere in the stadium, so you have to visually search for them.
Suppose that they are I.U. fans, wearing red and white clothes,
sitting somewhere on the I.U. side.  Do you think it would be easy to
spot them?  Probably not: You would have to look at each person, one
by one, to check whether he or she was one of your friends.  Suppose
instead that your friends, wearing red and white, were sitting on the
other team's side, whose school colors are, say, blue and yellow.  Do
you think it would be easy to spot your friends?  Probably, because
their red would "pop out" of the blue and yellow background.

<p>Thus, it seems that when we need to search for a unique feature
among other different features (e.g., red among blue and yellow), the
search is easy and we don't need to pay attention to individual items
(people).  But when we need to search for a conjunction of features
(e.g., a particular combination of facial features) among a sea of
similar items (other people with faces), the search is difficult and
we need to pay attention to each item (person) one at a time.

<p><IMG SRC="targtypes.gif" align=left> These kinds of visual search
situations can be brought into the laboratory and studied under
controlled conditions.  A popular experimental method used for
studying visual attention and pattern recognition is called the
"visual search paradigm".  In this paradigm, participants are shown a
display of items, such as large or small X's and O's like those shown
at the left.  The viewer has to search the display for one particular
type of item, called the "target", such as the small "x", and indicate
as quickly as possible whether or not this target is in display.
Typically the viewer indicates his or her response by pressing a key
if the target is present, and pressing a different key if the target
is absent.

<p>The displays are presented to the viewer suddenly, and the
experimenter measures the time it takes for the viewer to carry out
her visual search and respond.  Participants are told to maintain high
accuracy, so the crucial <em>dependent variable</em> (D.V.) is
response time (RT).

<p>There are at least three <em>independent variables</em> (I.V.'s) that
are of interest in visual search tasks.  One is whether the target is
present or absent.  A second I.V. is the number of items in the display.
The diagram below shows examples of displays in which the target (a
small "x") is absent or present, with low (4) or high (14) number of
items in the display.

<p>

</table>

<p>A third I.V. is the relation of the target and distractor items.
For example, the target might be a small "x", as above, but instead of
having distractors that could be small or large X's or O's, the
distractors might be just small x's or small o's.  This I.V. is
sometimes called "feature vs. conjunction search".  It is analogous to
looking for an I.U. fan in the other team's side vs. looking for the
I.U. fan on the I.U. side. Prof. Kruschke will discuss feature
vs. conjunction search in more detail in lecture.  It will not be
manipulated in this homework assignment.

<p><strong>Goal.</strong> The specific goal for this homework
assignment is for you to derive predicted response time graphs for two
different simple theories of visual search.  In lecture, we'll learn
about results from actual experiments, so we can see which theory
better fits real human performance.  The more general goal of this
assignment is for you to better understand theories and their relation
to data in cognitive psychology.

<p><strong>The two theories.</strong> Professor Kruschke emphasizes
that a theory must specify both the <em>representation</em> of
information and the <em>process</em> that acts on the representation.
The two theories presented here are not very explicit about the
representations they assume, and instead the emphasis is on the
different processes they assume.  (In class, however, we'll learn
about two different levels of representation, namely pre-attentive
features and post-attentive patterns, hypothesized in feature
integration theory.)  For this homework, you'll be deriving
predictions for two different kinds of processing.



<p><em>Theory 1: "Parallel" Processing of All Items.</em> It's
possible that when a display of items is presented, the viewer can
perceive all the items simultaneously, "in parallel."  According to
this idea, it doesn't matter how many items are in the display; they
can all be seen simultaneously in the same amount of time (so this
theory is sometimes called an "unlimited capacity" model).  This seems
to happen when searching for a red-clad I.U. fan in the other team's
side: The I.U. fan "pops out" no matter how many other people are in
the stands.

<p><center>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td align=center>
<IMG SRC="parallelsearch.gif"> 
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>A flowchart of this processing is shown above.  Each stage in the
flowchart takes a certain amount of time.  In particular, the time
taken to get through the "Perceive Items" box is the same no matter
how many items are in the display.

<p><em>Theory 2: Serial Processing of Items.</em> Alternatively, it's
possible that viewers can only perceive one item at a time.  Each item
must be checked, one at a time, to see whether it's the target or not.
This seems to happen when searching for the red-clad I.U. fan in the
I.U. side of the stadium.

<p><center>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td align=center>
<IMG SRC="serialsearch.gif"> 
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>A flowchart of this processing is shown above.  This flowchart does
not indicate which items get searched in what order, nor how the
viewer keeps track of which items have already been checked.  We'll
simply assume that the viewer checks items at random, with each item
mentally marked once it's been checked.  Each stage in the flowchart
takes a certain amount of time.  In particular, the loop of arrows,
from "Perceive an Item" through "Target Present?" and finally through
"Another Item", takes extra time for every additional item that needs
to be checked.  In this flowchart, we assume that if an item is
checked and it turns out to be the target, then further checking of
items is immediately stopped and the "present" key is pressed.
Because of this automatic stopping mechanism, this kind of serial
processing is called <em>self-terminating</em>.  (We'll encounter a
different kind of serial search, called "exhaustive", when we study
short-term memory.)


<p><strong>Compute the predicted response times.</strong> You need to
determine the mean response times predicted by the two theories, for
each of the four displays shown in the Introduction.  To make the
numbers concrete, we'll suppose that each stage in the flowcharts
above takes a certain amount of time, as follows:

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 width=50%>
<tr><td align=right><em>Stage</em></td>
<td align=right><em>Time in msec</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Start</td><td align=right>400</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Perceive Items<br>(in parallel processing)</td>
<td align=right>20</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Target Present?</td><td align=right>30</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Press "present" Key</td><td align=right>50</td></tr>

<tr><td align=right>Perceive an Item<br>(in serial processing)</td>
<td align=right>20</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Another Item?</td><td align=right>10</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p> Go through the flowcharts and add up the time taken by each stage
until a response is made.  The tables below have the stages listed in
order, so you can easily add up the durations of each stage.  Use the
tables below to compute the predicted response times. <em>Carefully
fill in all the blanks.</em>

<p><em>Careful!</em> The only somewhat tricky part is figuring out the
response time for <em>serial</em> processing when the target is
<em>present</em> (the last two tables above).  The are two reasons
that this is tricky, which we will consider in turn:

<p>First, consider how many items need to be searched when the target
is present.  The viewer might get lucky and find the target on the
first item she searches, or she might be unlucky and search every
other item before finally finding the target.  This is why the tables
say, for instance, "Iterate loop 1 to 4 times".  On average, the viewer
will get through half the items before she finds the target.  For
example, when the target is present and there are 4 items, on average
2.5 items must be checked to find the target, because 2.5 is the mean
of 1, 2, 3 and 4.  In general, if there are <em>N</em> items, the mean
number of items checked is (1+2+...+<em>N</em>)/<em>N</em>.  You
should compute the <em>mean</em> time required to find the target.

<p>Second, consider what happens once the target is found. When this
happens, it is no longer necessary to check for "Another Item?".
Therefore, on average, the stages "Perceive an Item" and "Target
Present?" are processed (1+2+...+<em>N</em>)/<em>N</em> times, but the
stage "Another Item?" is processed
[(1+2+...+<em>N</em>)/<em>N</em>]<strong>-1</strong> times.  Use these
average numbers of iterations to determine the predicted mean response
times.

<p><strong>Make graphs of the predicted response times.</strong> Blank
graph templates are provided below, one for plotting the predicted RTs
of the parallel processing theory, and the other for plotting the
predicted RTs of the serial processing theory.  The vertical axis is
the dependent variable.  The horizontal axis should be the independent
variable, number of items.  Your graphs should have separate lines for
each value of the other independent variable, target present or
absent.  Thus each graph should plot four points, one point for each
of the four display examples above.  Connect the points within a graph
that refer to target present, and connect the points within a graph
that refer to target absent. <strong>Important: Label all the axes,
label the tic marks on the axes, and label the lines you
plot.</strong>

<p><strong>So what?</strong> What does this tell us about perception?
We'll find out in lecture that people's search times are best fit by
the parallel processing theory for some types of displays, but best
fit by the serial processing theory for other types of displays.  By
carefully considering which types of displays seem to be processed in
parallel and which types seem to be processed serially, we can make
inferences about what sorts of visual features are perceived
<em>pre-</em>attentively, and what other sorts of visual patterns
require attentive processing to be recognized.

<p>The issue of parallel versus serial processing will arise again
later, in the topic of short-term memory scanning.
