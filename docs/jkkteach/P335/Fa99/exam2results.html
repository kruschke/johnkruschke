<p><h2>Exam 2 Results</h2>

<p>Exam  class statistics:

Total points possible: 102 (34 questions at 3 points each).
<br>Mean: 75.0
<br>SD: 12.0
<br>Min: 37
<br>Max: 95
<br>N: 51

<p>There was notable improvement from exam 1 to exam 2.  On average,
people increased their score by 8.04 points, and this is hugely
significant, statistically.

<p>There was also a very strong correlation between exam 1 scores and
exam 2 scores: <em>r</em>=.51, again hugely significant statistically.
Thus, people who did well on the first exam tended to do well on the
second exam.
