<h2>Late Policy</h2></center>

<p>All exams, papers and homeworks are mandatory.

<p>If you know in advance that you will be missing an exam or a paper
or homework due date, please notify Professor Kruschke as soon as
possible, and well before the due date, so that alternative
arrangements can be made.

<p>If you unexpectedly miss an exam or paper or homework due date, you
must notify Professor Kruschke <em>as soon as possible</em>,
preferably the same day, by phone or e-mail if not in person.  Only
<em>documented</em> emergencies will be excused.

<p>If an exam is missed, a make-up exam might have a different format
than the exam given in class, at the instructor's discretion.

<p><strong>Penalties</strong> for <em>unexcused</em> late homework and
papers are as follows:

<ul>

<li>Homework: One third of the points possible are deducted off the
top for homework handed in up to a week late.  After a week, a score
of <em>zero</em> is assigned.  Thus, for homework handed in less than
a week late, a maximum of 10 points (= 2/3 x 15) is possible.  For
homework handed in more than a week late, no points are awarded.

<li>Paper proposals: No points are possible for late proposals.  This
is because the proposals are due the class immediately before the full
paper is due.

<li>Papers: One third of the points possible are deducted off the top
for papers handed in up to a week late.  After a week, a score of
<em>zero</em> is assigned.  Thus, for papers handed in less than a
week late, a maximum of 13 points (= 2/3 x 20) is possible.  For
papers handed in more than a week late, no points are awarded.

</ul>
