</pre>

<p>To make sure that we're talking about the same rule, I'll re-state
the version that I used in lecture:

<p>
<center>
What are the only (two) cards that must be turned over to verify the rule:
<br>
<em>If it has vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other
side.</em>
<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=30>
<tr>

<td>
<table border=5 cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<td align=center>
A
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>

<td>
<table border=5 cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<td align=center>
4
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>

<td>
<table border=5 cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<td align=center>
K
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>

<td>
<table border=5 cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<td align=center>
3
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>

</table>
</center>

<p>Certainly the A must be checked, because if there is an odd number
on the other side, then the rule is violated.

<p>Many people think that the 4 must be checked, but this is not
necessary.  It doesn't matter what's on the other side of the 4.  If
there is a consonant on the other side, that's okay, because the rule
only says what's required if there's a vowel on one side.

<p>The other card that must be checked is the 3 (and many people find
this difficult).  To understand this, you need to realize that the
rule would be violated if the backside of the 3 had a vowel.  For
example, suppose the backside of the 3 had a letter E (a vowel).
Then, for the rule to be obeyed, the frontside must have an even
number (not 3).  So, to make sure that the rule isn't violated, you
have to check the backside of the 3, to make sure that it doesn't have
a vowel.

<p>In general, for a rule of the form, <em>If P then Q</em>, you need
to check any card with <em>P</em> and any card with <em>NOT Q</em>.
People easily check cards with <em>P</em>, but find it difficult to
check cards with <em>NOT Q</em>, when the rule is abstract.  

<p>When the rule is a "permission" or "cheating" situation, then it
tends to be much easier to check.  For example, consider the rule,
<em>If drinking, then must be at least 21</em>.  People find it
trivially easy to check someone who is <em>drinking</em> and to check
someone who is <em>NOT at least 21</em>.

<p>For further reading, there are some related web pages linked into
the class schedule.

</pre>

<p><em>Wason card selection task:</em> See the Q and A above.

<p><em>Hill climbing and working backwards:</em> These are two problem
solving heuristics.  They are heuristics, not algorithms, because they
are not guaranteed to work.  

<p>When you use the hill climbing heuristic, your next step is just
whichever takes you closest to the goal, or the least far away from
the goal.  For example, when trying to solve a maze, when you
encounter a fork in the maze, you take the route that appears to lead
you in the direction of the goal.  Of course, you need to know the
direction of the goal to apply the hill-climbing heuristic.  In
pencil-and-paper mazes, you can see the direction of the goal.  In a
"rat's eye view" maze, you might not know the direction of the goal,
and so you couldn't apply the hill-climbing heuristic.  In the
missionaries and cannibals problem (a.k.a. the hobbits and orcs
problem, or the calvins and hobbes problem), using the hill-climbing
heuristic implies that you always try to move a full boat load of
beasties across the river when going from start-bank to finish-bank,
because that gets you closest to your goal of everyone on the
finish-bank, and you always try to move just one beastie back from
finish-bank to start-bank, because that gets you least far away from
your goal.


<p>The working-backwards heuristic is simply starting at the goal and
working backwards to the start.  This can sometimes be useful for
mazes (but not always), and it can sometimes be useful for other
problems too.  For example, when trying to write a term paper, it's
sometimes helpful to look at a finished paper on the topic, and then
work backwards to a thesis and argument of your own.  This application
of the heuristic solves the problem of getting the paper done, but
doesn't always provide the best solution to the problem of learning
the material well.

<p><em>Feelings in decision making:</em> Here's a repeat and expansion
of an answer provided below. There were at least two main points, as
follows:

<p>First, it is not always easy to verbalize our feelings about a
decision, yet some decisions depend crucially on feelings.  For
example, selecting a picture to hang on our wall depends on
difficult-to-justify gut feelings.  In fact, being forced to verbally
justify a choice can negatively influence the choice.

<p>Second, people with specific brain damage (in medial, orbital
region of pre-frontal cortex), that insulates them from their
feelings, do not make very good decisions, even in "pure reasoning"
situations.  Cases of this included Phineas Gage.  It seems that these
people don't have the emotional links necessary for properly acting
upon a choice.  Feelings are crucial even for the simplest everyday
decisions.

</pre>

<p><em>Aphasia and the president's speech:</em> This was a chapter
from Oliver Sach's book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.  When
watching a televised speech of the president (presumably Ronald
Reagan), many of the aphasics laughed at parts of the speech that the
normal observers didn't find funny.  These aphasics didn't understand
the exact words, just his gesture and intonation.  One aphasic had the
opposite problem: A clear literal understanding of words, but no
understanding of gesture and intonation.  This patient thought that
the speaker was either "brain damaged or lying".  The point is that
normals effortlessly and automatically integrate information from
gesture, intonation, and words.  The integration is broken in the
aphasics.  Another point is that politicians can take advantage of
normal, automatic integration.

<p><em>Schemas and scripts:</em>  The main thing to know about them in
the present context is that they are one explanation for how we
understand language.  That is, language is full of ambiguity, and to
understand even the simplest narratives, we bring to bear vast amounts
of background knowledge.  One possible form for this knowledge schemas
and scripts.  In artificial intelligence programs, schemas and scripts
have specific forms, but the terms are also used more loosely to refer
to just any kind of structured knowledge.

<p><em>Means/end analysis and hill climbing:</em>  Hill climbing is
described above.  Means-ends analysis is just analyzing a problem in
subproblems, and tackling the subproblem before tackling the whole
problem.  It's just a heuristic, because your particular subproblems
might not have tractable solutions.

<p><em>Dell's model of speech errors:</em>  The aspects of Dell's model
that I emphasized in class were these: First, words are split into
parts corresponding to the type of phoneme exchanges people make in
speech errors - onset, middle, coda (end).  Second, there is feedback
of activation between layers, like the interactive activation model of
letter perception.  Third, there is residual activation from previous
moments in time, so that phonemes might get activated enough for
production at the wrong time.

<p><em>Chomsky and Mackay:</em> This is too big a topic for a quick
summary. Nevertheless, here's an overview.  Chomsky's early theory was
just a formal sentence generator, without strong commitments to
psychological processes.  His goal was to specify the grammatical
structure of language.  His sentence generator started with
phrase-structure rewrite rules to create a deep structure for a
sentence, and then transformation rules were applied to generate a
surface structure for the sentence.  The hope was that this system
would generate all grammatic sentences, and only grammatical
sentences, so that it would constitute a complete specification of the
structure of the language.

<p>Psychologists then wondered whether Chomsky's formal sentence
generator had anything to do with language processing in the mind.  So
they looked for correspondences between Chomsky's theory and human
performance.  Mackay's experiment is one such study.

<p><em>The additive model based on our homework:</em> You should know
what this model claims about information integration, in terms of
representation and process, and the (graphical) form of its
predictions.

<a name="desiderata"><p><hr></a>

<pre>

> I'm having a hard time finding Representational desiderata for

> really appreciate it!  Thank you,
</pre>

<p>In a representation and process for problem solving, there are
three desirable qualities: First, the representation of the start
state should be complete; i.e., include all the relevant information.
Second, the process that gets you from the starting representation to
the goal representation should be efficient.  Third, the goal
representation must be explicit, otherwise the problem isn't solved
yet.

</pre>

<p><em>ELIZA, CYC, and the Turing test:</em> We had a computer demo in
class of ELIZA in action, and we also saw it discussed in the video on
the last day.  ELIZA is the computer therapist, that uses a few
lexical and grammatical tricks to (poorly) imitate conversation.  CYC
was discussed at length in the video.  It's a massive program that
tries to explicitly program common sense that's used for understanding
language.

<p><em>Spoonerism:</em> Lots of examples were given in class, such as
"The queer old dean" instead of the intended "The dear old queen".
The Reverend Spooner was (in-)famous for his speech errors.

<p><em>Aphasia:</em> See answer above.

</pre>

<p>You need to know such details only to the extent that they were actually
specified in lecture or in the book.  Such details were not emphasized in
the case of the Wason card selection task.  

<p>The I.V.'s of the Wason experiment include the type of card (for
the rule "If P then Q", the cards could be P, Q, Not-P, or Not-Q) and
the contextual situation (e.g., abstract situation vs. checking
drinkers).  The D.V. is accuracy in selection, and perhaps also speed
of selectin.  The task and results are specified in a previous Q and
A.

<p>The representations and processes in the various theories were only
vaguely specified.  We discussed four possible types of reasoning:
First, abstract logical rules (check P and check Not-Q).  Second,
exemplar-memory, in which you don't really "reason out" an answer, you
just remember the right thing to do from previous cases.  Third,
pragmatic reasoning schemas, such as how to check for rules of
permission.  Fourth, cheater detection mechanisms, which are activated
by appropriate social situations.

<a name="spooner"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> What do spoonerisms imply about the structure of speech?
</pre>

<p>Spoonerisms have a very specific form: They are always exchanges of
initial phonemes.  This implies (perhaps) that words have certain
types of psychological parts, namely, an onset part that is separate
from other parts.

<p>Keeping your knowledge <em>organized</em> is crucial for
understanding and for remembering.  The time you spend figuring
out how it all fits together will pay off in terms of
performance on exams and in terms of your enjoyment of the
class!

<p>To help digest the readings, it's crucial always to keep in
mind the "big picture" --- <em>why</em> is the author
discussing this particular thing in this particular place?
What point is it supposed to be illustrating or demonstrating?
Be sure you can answer this question; if you can't, then you
don't really understand!

<p>The knowledge organization diagram from the syllabus is
intended to help you keep the big picture.  Whenever you read
about an experiment in the book, or hear about one in lecture,
you should be able to fill in all the leaves of the knowledge
organization tree.  Sometimes an experment is discussed in
terms of its results only, without a theory thoroughly
described.  In these cases, you should at least be aware that
if a theory were proposed, it would have to specify
representation and process.

</pre>

<p>The Carpenter & Daneman model addresses word-by-word integration of
meaning.  The Kintsch model addresses phrase-by-phrase or
sentence-by-sentence integration of meaning.  The two models have a
lot in common, in that they both address how meaning is integrated
from one unit (word or sentence) to the next.  But they also differ in
some details, of course.  Does the word-integration model do
reinstatement searches?  Does the text-comprehension model have error
recovery heuristics?

<p><em>Saccades</em> are just rapid movements of the eyes between
fixations.  When people read, their eyes move in a series of rapid
jumps (saccades) and stops (fixations), not in a smooth flow.

<p>Regarding integration in text comprehension again...  You should
know how Kintsch's model addresses the three factors that affect
integration.  You should also know the basic processes in the model,
including, but not necessarily only, the construction-integration
cycle described in lecture, and the various ways that the model tries
to achieve integration using STM, inference, reinstatement search,
etc.

</pre>

<p>Don't worry about the difference in terminology.  They're really
just different labels for the same thing.

</pre>

<p>The direct and "less direct" ways of keeing information active in
STM are really not that different.  The direct way simply has the very
same words or concepts repeated in consecutive sentences.  The
indirect way has the same schema or <em>mental model</em> maintained
in consecutive sentences, without explicit repetition of the concepts.
Both cases lead to the same conclusion: Comprehension is better when
relevant preceding information is still active in STM.

<a name="avail"><p><hr></a>

<pre>

> could you please review whatyou want us to know about the famous names 
> experiment from lecture?  thanks for your time,
</pre>

<p>The availability heuristic states that people try to generate
examples of an event in order to estimate the probability of an event.
The more examples they can come up with, the higher the probability
estimate.

<p>For the famous names experiment, the famous names are easier to
remember.  So when estimating the probability (or proportion) of women
in the list, the people actually are remembering the famous names, and
the list happened to have more famous women than famous men, even
though the list had more men overall.

<p>Yes, the "mood" topic does refer to Wright & Bower (p. 424).

<p>What should you know about the famous names experiment?  Know the
four leaves of the <a href="syllabus.html#exams">knowledge
organization diagram</a> (although in less detail than usual since we
did not dwell on this in class).  Know the basic procedure and task,
and the result. We did not discuss the independent variables in class,
although you can deduce that one I.V. was the proportion of women's
names and another was the proportion of <em>famous</em> women's names.
Then know the basic explanation in terms of the availability
heuristic.  This explanation emphasizes process, and does not specify
much about representation.

</pre>

<p>It's difficult for me to write a long discussion of every one of
these topics; I'll just provide some pointers.  Please <A
HREF=mailto:KRUSCHKE@indiana.edu>e-mail me</a> again if you have more
specific questions.

<p><em>Medical diagnosis.</em> (pp. 433-435) What was "one of the
major findings" of this study?  What was "a central issue"?  (The
phrases are in quotes because the book uses them exactly.)

<p><em>Schemas in language comprehension.</em> This is a very broad
topic and was discussed in several chapters of the textbook.  It was
first brought up on pp. 278-285 of Chapter 9, and then similar issues
were discusses throughout Chapters 10 and 11.  For example, see Figure
11.1, p.327.

<p><em>Logic of science.</em> Science can only deny the consequent;
i.e., it can only prove that theories are wrong in some way.  Science
cannot prove that a theory is correct (that is, affirming the consequent
- confirming a prediction - doesn't prove that the theory is correct).

<p><em>Feelings in decision making.</em> This was discussed in
lecture.  There were at least two main points.  First, it is not
always easy to verbalize our feelings about a decision, yet some
decisions depend crucially on feelings.  For example, selecting a
picture to hang on our wall depends on difficult-to-justify gut
feelings.  Second, people with specific brain damage, that insulates
them from their feelings, do not make very good decisions, even in
"pure reasoning" situations.  It seems that these people don't have
the emotional links necessary for properly acting upon a choice.

<p><em>Means-end analysis and hill climbing.</em> Both of these are
heuristics for problem solving.  Means-end analysis tries to solve
problems by analyzing sub-goals and solving the sub-goals.  Means-end
analysis can get stuck if a sub-problem can't be solved with the
available operators.  Hill-climbing is another heuristic, which tries
to solve problems by getting closer to the goal.  Hill-climbing can
get stuck if the true solution path requires a detour farther away
from the goal.

> Thanks,
</pre>

<p>This was discussed in class, along with the topic of conditional
reasoning, after the Wason card selection task.  Science can only deny
the consequent; i.e., it can only prove that theories are wrong in
some way.  Science cannot prove that a theory is correct (that is,
affirming the consequent - confirming a prediction - doesn't prove
that the theory is correct).
