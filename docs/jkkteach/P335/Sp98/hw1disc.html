<p>Here are a couple direct quotes from the description of
<em>parallel</em> processing in the homework: 

<blockquote>According to this idea [i.e., parallel processing], it
doesn't matter how many items are in the display; they can all be seen
simultaneously in the same amount of time ...  the time taken to get
through the "Perceive Items" box is the same no matter how many items
are in the display</blockquote>

<p>Does this answer your question?  If not, please <A

</pre>

<p>When the target is absent and there are 4 items, yes, that's right,
because in <em>serial</em> search you need to search successively
through all 4 items before you know that the target is not there.

<pre>
> and when the target is presen do do I multiply by 2.5???
</pre>

<p>Right, because on average you'd search 2.5 items before finding the
target.

<p>Sure.  Hope this helps!
