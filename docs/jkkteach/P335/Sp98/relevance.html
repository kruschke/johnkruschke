<h2>Relevance Papers</h2></center>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, one of
the goals of this course is for you to discover the relevance of
cognitive psychology to everyday life.  The "relevance paper"
assignments are designed to help you achieve this goal.  (These papers
are also referred to as "application" papers.)

<h2>
<strong>NEW:</strong>
Each paper's <em>topic</em> must correspond with concurrent course topic.
</h2>

<p>For each of the four relevance papers, the implications must draw
from material in the corresponding, concurrent course topics.  Thus,
the first relevance paper must draw implications from topics studied
in weeks 1-4, such as perception and attention, etc.  The second paper
must draw implications from topics studied during weeks 5-8, such as
memory and imagery.  And so on for the third and fourth papers.

<p>Implications from non-concurrent course topics will not be given
credit!  If, for example, you write about implications from
attentional research for your third relevance paper, you won't get
credit.

<p>The main <em>purpose</em> of this requirement is to make sure you
consider real-life implications from material <em>throughout</em> the
course.

<p>(This requirement contradicts a statement made in the initial
version of this assignment, which advised you to draw implications
from all topics in the course.  Unfortunately, this advice was
vestigial from last time this course was taught, when there was a
single large term paper instead of four small papers.)


<a name="structure"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>The required <em>structure</em> of the papers.</h2>

<p>Your paper should first describe the cognitive aspects of some life
situation.  The situation could be something you have personally
experienced, but could also be taken from a movie, or from
observations of animals, or even from observations of computers.  The
crucial qualities are that the situation should (1) be from life
outside the research laboratory, and (2) involve some sort of putative
cognition.

<p>Next, your paper should describe <em>three</em> implications for
the life situation derived from theories or experimental results in
cognitive psychology.  For each implication, you must accurately
summarize the relevant theory or result, concisely describe its
implication for the life situation, and describe a possible test of
the implication.

<p>When describing an experimental result, be sure to describe the
stimuli, task, procedure, independent variables and dependent
variables.

<p>When describing a theory, be sure to describe the representation
and process assumed by the theory, if possible.

<p>In outline form, the paper is structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation.
<li>Implications from cognitive psychology:
	<ol>
	<li>Implication #1.
		<ul>
		<li>Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	<li>Implication #2.
		<ul>
		<li>Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	<li>Implication #3.
		<ul>
		<li>Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	</ol>
</ul>


Below is an example of a paper.  This is only an abbreviated sketch of
a paper, and it is incomplete in its details. The papers you submit
should be written more carefully.  <em>Because I have provided this
outline, you may not write a paper on this topic (imagery in athletic
practice) for credit!</em>

<p><center> <strong>Sample Abbreviated Paper: Mental Imagery in
Learning to Ice Skate</strong></center>

<ul> 

<li><em>Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation: Mental
rehearsal of ice skating.</em> In trying to improve performance in a
new skill such as ice skating, I find that it helps to
<em>imagine</em> skating when off the ice.  My imagery emphasizes
smooth, fluid execution of various maneuvers.  This is not just
fantasized glory, but concentrated mental rehearsal of specific
realistic actions.  This mental rehearsal seems to form a cognitive
"rut" that can be more easily followed when I subsequently perform the
actual, physical skating.  (For more information about this
phenomenon, see the newspaper article reprinted on pp. 202-203 of
Reed, 4th Ed.)

<p><li><em>Implications from cognitive psychology.</em>

	<ol>
	<p><li><em>Implication #1: Failure of reality monitoring.</em> 
		<ul>

		<li><em>Statement of theory or laboratory result.</em>
In an experiment conducted by Johnson, Raye, Wang and Taylor (1979),
participants were shown either pictures of objects or names of these
objects.  When shown a name, the participant was instructed to imagine
the object named.  Two important independent variables were the number
of times an object's picture appeared, and the number of times an
object's name appeared.  After exposure to the pictures and names,
participants were given an unexpected test in which they had to
estimate the number of times they saw an item's picture.  The crucial
dependent variable, therefore, was the judged number of times a
picture was seen.  The results were that estimates increased not only
as a function of the actual number of times a picture was presented,
but also as a function of the number of times the object was merely
imagined. (For more details, see pp. 210-214 of Reed, 4th Ed.)

		<li><em>Specific implication for life situation.</em>
This result suggests that if people vividly imagine performing an
athletic skill such as skating, they will have difficulty
distinguishing the number of times that they actually went skating
from the number of times that they merely imagined skating.  It also
implies that if people imagined some particular action, such as a
jump, then their estimates of the number of times they've actually
jumped should be inflated by the number of times they've merely
imagined jumping.  In other words, people won't be able to fully
distinguish reality from imagination.

		<li><em>Possible test of the implication.</em> This
implication could be tested by having different participants in a
skating class perform certain maneuvers (such as turns, stops, jumps,
etc.) a specific number of times, and also having them imagine these
maneuvers a certain number of times.  After the class, students would
be asked to estimate how many times they actually executed the various
maneuvers.  The implication would be confirmed if people's estimates
were positively influenced by the number of times they imagined the
maneuvers.

		</ul>

	<p><li><em>Implication #2: Mental imagery might have a speed
limit.</em>
		<ul>

		<li><em>Statement of theory or laboratory result.</em>
Shepard and Metzler found that response times to match two complex
figures increased linearly with the angle of rotation between the two
figures.  One explanation of their result is that mental rotation has
a maximal speed, so that larger rotations demand greater time to
mentally traverse. (For more details, see pp.197-199 of Reed, 4th Ed.)

		<li><em>Specific implication for life situation.</em>
Does this imply that there is a speed limit for athletic imagery as
well?  For example, if imagining a spin during a jump, will
imagination be able to keep up with real life spinning?  Will athletes
sometimes imagine things too slowly?  And if so, will this have
detrimental effects instead of beneficial effects, contrary to what
coaches believe?

		<li><em>Possible test of the implication.</em> To test
this implication, we first need to determine whether people can
imagine athletic actions in real time.  One possible way to do this
would be to have athletes imagine various maneuvers, and press a
button at the moments their imagined maneuvers begin and end.  We
could then measure to what extent the durations of imagined actions
corresponded with real actions.  If imagined actions are in fact much
slower than real actions, then we could go on to test whether this
too-slow imagination is detrimental.  We might have some people
imagine only complex events that cannot be imagined as quickly as real
time, and have other people imagine only simple events that can be
imagined as quickly as real time, and then assess any improvement (or
worsening) in actually executing the skill.  If it turns out that too
slow imagery is detrimental, we've learned something useful!

		</ul>

	<p><li><em>Implication #3. Mental imagery might suffer
distortions.</em>
		<ul>

		<li><em>Statement of theory or laboratory result.</em>
We learned in lecture about various systematic mistakes people make
when judging relative locations of cities.  One explanation of these
mistakes is that mental map reading suffers from systematic
distortions, called alignment and rotation heuristics.  (For more
details, see the article by B. Tversky, 1981, cited in the textbook.)

		<li><em>Specific implication for life situation.</em>
Does this imply that athletic imagery will also suffer distortions?
For example, will skaters imagine the angle of their bodies or skates
incorrectly?  Will this have detrimental effects for performance?

		<li><em>Possible test of the implication.</em>
As with the previous implication, testing this implication would have
to proceed in two steps:  First, determine whether there is any
distortion in imagery.  Second, if there is distortion, assess its
effect on performance.  Testing for distortion in imagery could be
analogous to what Tversky did.  For example, skaters could be asked
about the relative locations of their hands and feet at a particular
time in a maneuver.  If distortions do exist and they are detrimental,
then we've learned something useful, and can proceed to try to
compensate for these distortions.

<a name="proposal"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>Paper <em>proposals</em> and <em>discussions</em>.</h2>


<p>Before each paper is due, you must write a brief proposal.  In the
proposal, describe the life situation and <em>just one</em>
implication from cognitive psychology.


<p>In outline form, the proposal is structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation.
<li>An implication from cognitive psychology:
	<ul>
	<li>Statement of theory or laboratory result.
	<li>Specific implication for life situation.
	<li>Possible test of the implication.
	</ul>
</ul> 
You only need to make very brief descriptions in your proposal; much
less cohesive than in the full-length paper.


<p>Make two copies of your proposal, which you should bring to class
the day that the proposal is due.  You hand in one copy at the
beginning of class.  Keep the other copy for classroom discussion.

<p>In classroom discussion, we will split up into groups.  Each member of
the group will briefly tell the group about his or her proposal.  Then
the group will decide which proposed implication is the most viable
and interesting.  Your group decides exactly what is "interesting",
but often an implication is interesting if it is unexpected or somehow
makes a quantum leap from the laboratory to life.  After all the
groups have decided on their most interesting proposals, the author of
each group's most interesting proposal will briefly summarize his or
her idea to the whole class.

<a name="grading"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>Criteria for <em>grading</em> of papers and proposals.</h2>

<p><em>Proposals</em> that are (1) turned in on time (at the beginning
of the appropriate class) and (2) complete in content (including a
life situation, a theory or result, an implication, and a possible
test) will be awarded 5 points. 

<p><em>Full papers</em> are graded as follows.  Each content section
gets 0-2 points, as shown below:

<ul>
<li>(2 pts.) Description of cognitive aspects of a life situation.
<li>Implications from cognitive psychology:
	<ol>
	<li>Implication #1.
		<ul>
		<li>(2 pts.) Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>(2 pts.) Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>(2 pts.) Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	<li>Implication #2.
		<ul>
		<li>(2 pts.) Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>(2 pts.) Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>(2 pts.) Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	<li>Implication #3.
		<ul>
		<li>(2 pts.) Statement of theory or laboratory result.
		<li>(2 pts.) Specific implication for life situation.
		<li>(2 pts.) Possible test of the implication.
		</ul>
	</ol>
</ul>

<p>2 points are awarded to sections that clearly and concisely include
all the relevant details necessary to explain the theory, implication,
or test.

<p>1 point is awarded for sections that are approximately correct, but
that lack some important detail or include some erroneous statement,
or that are vague or unclear.

<p>0 points are given for sections that are essentially redundant with
other sections, or which are excessively brief, vague or obscure, or
which are fundamentally wrong.

<p>The above criteria presume that the topic drawn from is concurrent
with the course material (see the <a href="#restrict">topic
restrictions</a> above).  If the topic does not correspond with
concurrent course material, no credit can be awarded.

<p><em><a href="releval.html">Evaluations</a></em> of the relevance
paper assignments are awarded 2 points, if they are submitted at the
appropriate time.

<p><em>Summary:</em> 
The proposal is worth up to 5 points.
The papers are worth up to 20 points.
The evaluation is worth up to 2 points.
Thus, each paper assignment is worth up to 27 points total.

<h2>Hints and comments.</h2>


<p><strong>Common problems with papers:</strong>

<ul>

<p><li><strong>Not drawing from concurrent course material.</strong>
Your implications for each paper must draw from concurrent topics in
the course.  See the <a href="#restrict">topic restrictions</a> above.

<p><li><strong>Misunderstanding or misstating an effect or
theory.</strong> Whenever you're making a connection with something
discussed in class, make sure you correctly understand and clearly
state that something!  When describing an experimental result, be sure
to describe the stimuli, task, procedure, independent variables and
dependent variables.  When describing a theory, be sure to describe
the representation and process assumed by the theory, if possible.

<p><li><strong>Renaming the same point two or three times, trying to
make several implications out of one.</strong> The three different
implications need to be three <em>different</em> implications.

<p><li><strong>Improperly using "affect" and "effect":</strong> 

<p><center>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 width=90%>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align=center>AFFECT</td>
<td align=center>EFFECT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noun</td>
<td>"affect" as a noun means an emotion.  This usage is uncommon in
everday conversation, but does occur often in technical writing.
<p><em>The actor conveyed intense affect.</em></td>

<td>"effect" as a noun means a change, or a consequence.
<p><em>The manipulation produced a significant effect.</em></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Verb</td>

<td>"affect" as a verb means to influence.
<p><em>Depth of processing affects memory.</em></td>

<td>"effect" as a verb means to bring about, or to bring into being.
This usage is fairly rare.  <p><em>Utilization of interactive imagery
effects correct recall.</em></td>

</tr>

</table>
</center>

<p><li><strong>Piling on more than three implications.</strong> You
can probably think of dozens of possible implications, but choose
<em>the best three</em>. Think deeply about those bests ones, and then
write carefully about them.  You only get credit for the first three
implications you describe.


<p><li><strong>Saying way too much or too little about a theory or
experiment.</strong> Say just enough to express clearly exactly what
you think the application is.  Please do not "parrot" the whole
complex design of an experiment just to show you know it; you'd
actually just be showing a lack of discretion and lack of clarity.  On
the other hand, don't just "telegraph" a topic, leaving important
aspects merely implied.  Be explicit about exactly what you think the
important point is, but don't pack it with unnecessary baggage.
