<IMG SRC="compmet.gif" align=left> <strong>Course Topic:</strong>
Cognitive psychologists study how people perceive and attend to the
environment, how people learn and remember, how they comprehend and
produce language, and how they reason and make decisions.  I
(Prof. Kruschke) define cognitive psychology as the <em>reverse
engineering</em> of <em>mind</em>.  Reverse engineering is a procedure
that analyzes a working machine into its parts and interactions, with
the goals of explaining, manipulating, and replicating the behavior of
the machine.  For example, aerospace engineers in various countries
have been working hard to reverse engineer the American ``Stealth''
bomber.  In cognitive psychology, the object of inquiry is the mind, a
far more elusive target than the Stealth Bomber.  Cognitive psychology
treats the mind as the software, or program, that runs on the computer
hardware of the brain.  As illustrated in the figure at left, this
<em>computer metaphor</em> asserts that mind (the ``thought bubble'')
is to brain (the head) as software (the flowchart) is to hardware (the
circuit board).  Thus, one goal of cognitive psychology is to figure
out the flow of information processing in the complicated program
implemented by the brain.  The point of the computer metaphor is not
to assert that the mind <em>is</em> a program, rather, the point is
that we might study human cognition at the level of information
processing (software) separately from the level of neural processing
(hardware).  <p>

<a name="goals"></a> <IMG SRC="knoworgsmall.gif" align=left>
<strong>Goals of This Course:</strong> The figure at left shows how
knowledge in this course is organized, and it also shows the main
goals of the course.  The course includes many topics or themes
(indicated at the top of the figure), such as attention, perception,
memory, etc., and within each topic are many phenomena, such as the
limited capacity of attention, or the distinction between long-term
and short-term memory.  One goal of the course, indicated at the
middle-left of the figure, is for you to discover real-life examples
of those phenomena, so that the relevance of the material to our lives
is clear.  Another goal of the course is for you to understand
thoroughly the scientific reasoning underlying laboratory
experimentation, as indicated by the lower branches of the tree in the
figure. The overall goal is for you to understand better the relations
between laboratory data, theory, and everyday life, in science
generally, not only in cognitive psychology. (For week-by-week topical
goals, click <a href="goals.html">here</a>.) <p>

<a name="exams"></a> <IMG SRC="knoworgbot.gif" align=left>
<strong>Exam Format:</strong> Exams will consist mostly of short-essay
questions (answers of two or three paragraphs), combined with some
multiple-choice questions. Typically an exam will have six or seven
essay questions, and you need not answer one or two of your choice.
Each exam will cover only the material discussed since the previous
exam. The essay questions tend to emphasize the lower branches of the
knowledge organization, as reproduced in the figure at left. (In the
figure, ``IV'' and ``DV'' stand for independent variable and dependent
variable, respectively.)  <em>Your answers to exam questions should
explicitly address each of the boxes of the tree.</em> The exams help
you accomplish the goals of organizing your knowledge in a way that
applies to science (and life) generally.  <p>

<strong>Exam Schedule:</strong> There will be three mid-term exams and
a final exam (4 exams total).
<br>Mid-Term Exam 1: Tuesday, 19 September
<br>Mid-Term Exam 2: Thursday, 12 October.
<br>Mid-Term Exam 3: Tuesday, 7 November.
<br>Final Exam: 12:30--2:30 pm, Thursday, 14 December.
<p>

<strong>Exam Grading:</strong> For every question, a key will be
prepared that outlines the essential details needed for full credit,
and the possible credit for each part. Each exam is worth 100 points.
If you want to dispute a score you receive, you must submit your
reasons <em>in writing</em>, along with your scored exam. This policy
is helpful for two reasons: First, if a score change is justified, it
gives us a paper document as a record of the change. Second, it gives
you a chance to think through and present your argument carefully, to
maximize your chances of success. 
<p>

<strong>Exam Attendance:</strong> All four exams are
mandatory. Missing an exam is <em>strongly</em> discouraged! If you
know in advance that you must miss an exam, please let me know ahead
of time, and it will usually be possible to take the exam one or two
days before the scheduled date. If you unexpectedly miss an exam, you
may take a make-up exam <em>only</em> if you have a cogent excuse,
and <em>only</em> if you discuss the absence with me as soon as
possible (typically the same or next day, via phone or e-mail if not
in person). Make-up exams might not have the same format as in-class
exams, and instead might consist entirely of essay questions.
<p>

<a name="applications"></a> <IMG SRC="knoworgtop.gif"
align=right><strong>"Applications" Papers:</strong> Due at the
beginning of each exam is a brief paper that describes a "real-life"
application of theoretical issues discussed in class. Whereas the
exams emphasize the lower levels of the knowledge organization, the
"application" papers emphasize the higher levels, as reproduced in the
figure at right. The papers are designed to achieve the goal of
relating cognitive psychology to everyday life.  <p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>"Applications" Papers Content and Format:</strong>
	<dd>You must find an article (or advertisement) in the
<em>popular, non-academic</em> media (newspaper, magazine, popular
book, phone directory, World Wide Web, or even TV or radio
<em>provided you have an exact transcript</em>) that exemplifies a
real-life application of issues discussed in class. In your paper, (1)
summarize the item, emphasizing the aspects that are relevant to the
course; (2) explain exactly how particular theories and/or experiments
discussed in class and in the textbook relate to the real-life
situation; and, (3) discuss implications for the real-life situation
that are not mentioned in the item, based on theories and/or
experiments discussed in class. Also, (4) be sure to include a
photocopy of the item, and an exact citation of the source of the item
(including pages numbers, dates, place of publication, etc.). That way
I can go to the original source if I would like to use it for future
classes.  <em>Please see <a href="app1.html#appstruct">further
explanation of the paper structure</a> located with comments about the
papers.</em>  <dt><strong>"Applications" Papers Topic:</strong>
	<dd>The topic should be one covered in the corresponding
fourth of the course. For example, for the first fourth of the course,
the topic should be something to do with perception, attention, or the
"cognitive" approach to psychology.
<dt><strong>"Applications" Papers Length:</strong>
	<dd>Each paper should be about three pages long, double-spaced
and typed. Five pages maximum, please.
<dt><strong>"Applications" Papers Grading:</strong>
	<dd>Each paper is worth up to 20 points. Papers are graded for
how well they satisfy the four parts specified above (summary of
relevance, 6 pts.; explanation of specific relations, 6 pts.;
discussion of implications, 6 pts.; photocopy and citation, 2 pts.).
<p>
<dt><strong><em>We will keep all papers, so be sure to make a
copy for yourself before turning them in</em></strong>.
</dl>
<p>

<strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Course grades will be based on
absolute thresholds for total points, summing exam points plus paper
points (480 possible), according to the following scale: 461-480 A+,
437-460 A, 418-436 A-, 399-417 B+, 380-398 B, 360-379 B-, 341-359 C+,
322-340 C, 303-321 C-, 240-302 D, 0-239 F. It is Psychology Department
policy to give incompletes ("I" grades) only with a valid medical
excuse.  <p>

<strong>Electronic Classroom:</strong> This class has an electronic
classroom on the World Wide Web. Announcements, review questions, exam
keys and scores, etc., will be posted there, and an electronic
newsgroup will be used for class discussion. How to access the Web
with Netscape will be demonstrated in class. The URL for our class is<br>

<strong>Hints for Studying:</strong>
<OL>
<LI><em>Save this syllabus.</em>
<p>
<LI><em>Organize your knowledge.</em>
<p>
	<DL>
	<DT>(a) One of the best ways to understand and remember the
information in this course is to organize your knowledge with the
organizational structure shown in the "goals" section, above. For
everything we discuss, you should be able to fill in all the
components of this structure. This will be emphasized and explained
throughout the course.
	<p>
	<DT>(b) The order of topics is not random. If you understand
the material, you should be able to explain why one topic came before
the other. One motivation for the ordering of topics is following
along the flow of information processing from the sensory periphery
(e.g., vision) to central cognition (e.g., problem solving). This
ordering is the level of organization <em>above</em> the structure in
the "goals" diagram; this is the level that organizes one topic
relative to another.
	</DL>
<p>
<LI><em>Ask questions.</em>  Ask in class, ask at office hours, ask via
the Web, ask in review sessions, ask in the library, ask at University
Computing Services. And keep asking until you understand the answers.
<p>
<LI><em>Use our class Web page and news group.</em> Post questions,
answers, and discussion. Topics for review, and exam results, also
will be posted there.

<strong>Why Take this Course:</strong> P335 can partially fulfill the
Area A Requirement for the Psychology Major (B.A. or B.S.), and it
also fulfills the Mathematical Sciences and Cognition sub-area of the
Distribution Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree in the College of
Arts and Science. It can also fulfill requirements in other majors,
such as Cognitive Science. I hope, however, you find that the value of
the course extends far beyond the curricular requirements it fulfills.
As a result of learning about applied human cognition you can be
better decision makers, better evaluators of information in the media,
and more tolerant and understanding of human behavior. By learning
about experiments and various theories, you can learn about the
process of scientific thinking, not just its ultimate products.
Finally, by understanding the theories, you learn about a contemporary
approach to one of the most exciting areas of inquiry for the
twenty-first century, the workings of the mind. Two indications of its
importance are that the College now includes "Cognition" in the title
of one of its required sub-areas, and there is a new major called
"Cognitive Science."  <p>
