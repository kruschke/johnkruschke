<dt>26 Sept., Tuesday <dd><strong>EXAM 2 is postponed</strong> until
Tuesday October 17.<p>

<dt>26 Sept., Tuesday <dd>There is now a helpful list of <a
href="http://pcfwww.ucs.indiana.edu/tltl/documents/lockerfaq.html">
Frequently Asked Questions about Student Lockers, Netscape,
Newsgroups, etc.</a><p>

<dt>25 Sept., Monday <dd>The Student Academic Center offers courses in
<strong>study skills</strong>, including time management, reading and
notetaking, library use, etc.  There are courses for credit, personal
counselors, and computer tutorials.  They are located at 316 N.
Jordan, and their phone number is 855-7313.<p>

<dt>18 Sept., Monday <dd>The Psychology Department will sponsor a
colloquium on October 20th at 3:30 p.m. in room 101 Psychology.  Dr.
Martha Farah from the University of Pennsylvania will speak about her
research on <strong>face recognition</strong>: "Does the Human Visual
System Contain a 'Face Module'?"  Abstract: I will present evidence
from a variety of brain-damaged patients supporting the idea of a
neuroanatomically distinct, functionally independent processor that
operates manditorily on face inputs. (Attendance is not required; this
is posted just for your info.)  <p>

Another interesting talk: Kathleen McDermott, Rice University.  Friday
Sept. 22 at 1:30PM in the Psychology Conference room (within the Main
Office).  Talk title: "<strong>Illusory Memories</strong>" Abstract:
Roediger and McDermott (1995, JEP:LMC) recently reintroduced a
paradigm to study the creation of false memories. Subjects hear lists
of related words (e.g., thread, pin, eye, sewing, etc.), all of which
are associates of a critical non-presented word e.g., needle. On a
free recall test given immediately after list presentation, subjects
often erroneously recall the critical non-presented word at levels
similiar to retrieval of studied words from long-term memory. On a
recognition test, the false alarm rate for these items approaches the
hit rate.  I will provide a summary of the original experiments and
then present data from new experiments that explore the study/test
opportunities.  In addition, the results demonstrate the critical
importance of repeated retrieval in the development of false
memory.<p>


<dt>14 Sept., Thursday <dd><strong>EXAM 1 POSTPONED</strong> until
Thursday Sept 21.  Mike will have a review session on Tuesday evening
at 7:00pm until 9, in room 143 Geology (across the street from Psych).
<a href="exam1.html">Review questions</a> will be posted here by
Monday, and paper copies distributed in class on Tuesday.  The
applications papers are also due on Thursday, not Tuesday.<p>

<dt>13 Sept., Wednesday <dd>The bibliographic database
<strong>PsycINFO</strong> is now online via the IU Libraries.  Click
on <a HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~libweb/index.html"> <strong>I.U.
Libraries</strong></a> and then scroll down to the section
<strong>Indexes to Journal and Newspaper Articles</strong> and then
click on <strong>PsycINFO</strong>.<p>

<dt> 04 Sept., Monday <dd> The bookstores have run out of copies of
the textbook, and have ordered a few more.  They should arrive this
week (they hope!).  If you have not yet purchased a book, <em>be sure
to order one from a bookstore</em> to be sure that they order enough!
(By the way, months ago I ordered more copies of the book than there
are enrollees in our class, and checked the week before classes to
make sure they had arrived.  So either the bookstores didn't order as
many as I requested, or some other section of P335, using the same
textbook, didn't order enough.)  Until more books arrive, borrow a
book from a classmate.<p>

<dt> 30 August, Wednesday <dd> New Web page address: Because the
computer, Silver, is so slow (too many users), I have moved our web
pages to a faster site.<br> Our P335 web page is now at
<pre>http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/p335.html</pre><br> My
homepage is now at
<pre>http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/home.html</pre><p>



<dt> 29 August, Tuesday <dd> New office hours for Prof. Kruschke:
Beginning the second week of classes, my Tuesday 4-5 office hour will
be changed to Wednesday 11-12.  So, new office hours are Wed 11-12 and
Thurs 4-5. <p>

<dt>25 August, Friday 
<dd>Announcements will be posted here, in reverse chronological order,
so that the most recent announcement is listed first. <p>

<H2>P335 Newsgroup</H2>

Students: For posting to our newsgroup, it is imperative to run
Netscape from your Student Lockers. The Netscape documentation is
written from the perspective of the Student Locker, so hopefully, this
won't become a problem.  NOTE: Accessing the newsgroup can be
especially tricky from Mac's.  Please read about "personalizing
Netscape for the Mac" in the documents cited below.  <p>

You should refer to the following documents:<br> <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b119/"> Netscape 1.1N in the IUB
public computing sites </a> <br> <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b073/"> The Student Locker
handbook</a> <br> <a
href="http://pcfwww.ucs.indiana.edu/tltl/documents/lockerfaq.html">
