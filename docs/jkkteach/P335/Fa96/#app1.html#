<h2>Further explanation of the paper structure</h2>

The <a href="syllabus.html#applications">syllabus</a> introduces the
applications paper assignments.  Here is some further explication of
the structure required in the paper.<p>

The three parts of the paper can be explained as follows.  Imagine the
information in the article you find as a set of "factoids." You can
think of each factoid as a point in a set, like this:

<pre>
   Article
   +-----+
   | . . |  (The points indicate factoids.)
   |  .  |
   | .   |
   |   . |
   +-----+
</pre>

Your first job in the paper is to <em>highlight and summarize</em> the
points that are relevant to our class:

<pre>
   Article
   +-----+
   | o . |  (The circles indicate factoids
   |  o  |   that have been highlighted in
   | .   |   your summary.)
   |   o |
   +-----+ 
</pre> 

Now imagine all the material in class as a set of concepts (actually a
highly structured and organized set of concepts):

<pre>
                      Class Concepts      
                   +---------------------+
   (Each point     |     .        .      |
    indicates      |   .     .   .       |
    a concept.)    |       .          .  |
                   |     .   .      .    |
                   |  .         .        |
                   |   .   .     .       |
                   |           .       . |
                   +---------------------+
</pre>

Your second job in the paper is to <em>link</em> the relevant article
factoids with appropriate concepts from class.  For example, you could
say that a particular fact in the article is an example of a
phenomenon discussed in class.  In terms of the diagram, you are
pointing from a factoid in the article to a concept in class:

<pre>
   Article            Class Concepts      
   +-----+         +---------------------+
   | o==================>o        .      |
   |  o=====================>o   .       |
   | .   |         |       .          .  |
   |   o================>o   .      .    |
   +-----+         |  .         .        | 
                   |   .   .     .       |
	           |           .       . |
	           +---------------------+
</pre>

Your third job in the paper is to draw <em>implications</em> from the
class concepts to the article.  Consider a variety of class concepts
and their implications. In terms of the diagram, implications are
connections from various class concepts back to the article:

<pre>
   Article            Class Concepts      
   +-----+         +---------------------+
   | o<=================>o        .      |
   | ^o<====================>o   .       |
   | ^   |         |       .          .  |
   | ^ o<===============>o   .      .    |
   +-^-^-+         |  .         .        | 
     ^ ^<==============o   .     .       |
     ^<========================o       . |
                   +---------------------+
</pre>

This third part of the paper is where you can be most thoughtful, and
is supposed to be the most interesting part of the paper for you.
It is your chance to explore what the various theories and concepts
imply for real life.


<a name="example"></a>
<p><hr>
<h2>Example outline of a paper.</h2>

<p> 
This is NOT supposed to be a complete and thorough example of an
application paper.  It is supposed to be suggestive of the range of
links and implications that you can come up with!

<p>This outline shows more than five links and implications, merely to
suggest a range of possibilities. As stated above, please do not
include more than five of each in your paper.

<p> 
Consider the article reproduced on pp. 202-203 of Reed (4th Ed.),
regarding mental imagery and athletic performance.  <em>Because I
provide this outline for this topic (imagery and athletic
performance), you may NOT use this topic for your application
paper.</em>

<p>
Your paper <em>must</em> have explicit headers demarcating each
section, like the bold headers below.

<p> 
<strong>Summary.</strong> I will not summarize the article here, but
however you summarize it, you should highlight points relevant to the
course.  For example, the fact that Unestahl's experiment included 53
participants is not very relevant.  On the other hand, the fact that
imagery must include movement <em>is</em> relevant.

<p> 
<strong>Links to course material.</strong> You must include 
five distinct links to material from various parts of the course.
Each link <em>must</em> be explicitly demarcated.  Just a few of the
possible links are indicated below.  For each link, you should add a
few sentences describing and explicating the link.

<ol>

<li><em>Attention and interference.</em> The article says the
preferred technique is to imagine and hum a tune.  This links to the
topic of attention and interference in class, because the humming is
designed, presumably, to block out interfering verbal/acoustic
thoughts, and focus attention on the visual imagery.

<li><em>Practice and expertise.</em> The article says that the
athletic imagery must be practiced, like actual practice.  This links
to the topic of practice and expertise in class, wherein we learned
that Anders Erickson claims that practice is all there is to
expertise.  Here we have "virtual" practice, in the form of imagery.
(Can imagery itself be practiced, so one can become an expert imager?)

<li><em>Confabulated memories.</em> The article implies that the
imagined practice had beneficial effects for later performance.  That
is, the imagined practice is remembered as if it were real practice.
This links to the topic of confabulated memory, like the boy in
Elizabeth Loftus' study who confabulated a memory of being lost in a
shopping mall.

<li><em>Reality monitoring.</em> The article implies that imagined
practice is remembered like, or has effects like, real practice.  This
links to the class topic of reality monitoring, and the partial
failure to recall whether an event was real or imagined.

<li><em>Imagery produces stronger memory than words.</em> The article
describes the effectiveness of imagery for remembering skills, which
links to what we learned about in class regarding the advantage of
memory for images relative to words.

<li><em>Event scripts.</em> The article describes a sequence of verbal
instructions that is supposed to be detrimental to fluid performance.
Such a sequence of instructions links to the notion of scripts,
discussed in class.

<li><em>Procedural memory.</em> The learning of an atheletic skill, as
describe in the article, links to the notion of procedural memory (as
opposed to semantic or episodic memory).  Seems that athletes are
emphasizing procedural memory in this situation.

<li><em>Analogue vs. propositional representation.</em> The article
suggests that athletes do get verbal instructions from coaches, but
must translate those instructions into fluid imagery.  This links to
two forms of representation discussed in class: The athletes need to
translate propositional instructions into analogue imagery.

</ol>

<p> <strong>Implications of course material for the real-life
situation.</strong> You must include at least five distinct
implications from material from various parts of the course.  Each
link <em>must</em> be explicitly demarcated.  Just a few of the
possible implications are indicated below.  For each implication, you
should add a few sentences describing and explicating the implication.

<ol>

<li><em>Mental rotation.</em> Shepard and Metzler suggested a "speed
limit" on mental rotation. Does this imply that there is a speed limit
for athletic imagery? If so, will athletes imagine things too slowly?
Will it have detrimental effects?

<li><em>Cognitive map heuristics.</em> We learned that mental maps
suffer from systematic distortions, called alignment and rotation
heuristics.  Does this imply that athletic imagery will also suffer
distortions?  For example, will skiers imagine the angle of their skis
and poles incorrectly?  Will this have detrimental effects?

<li><em>Context bound imagery.</em> We learned in the Baker and Santa
study that memory for images can become context bound.  Does that
imply that athletic imagery will also be context bound?  Will the
beneficial effects transfer to new situations?  Should the imagery
include imagining different contexts (e.g., different ski slopes) in
which contests occur?

<li><em>Interference of imagery and perception.</em> We learned that
imagery and perception can interfere with each other, as in Brooks'
study.  This implies that if the athlete tries to imagine while
actually performing the event, there will there be detrimental
interference.

<li><em>Imagery and creativity.</em> We learned that imagery can be
useful in problem solving. Does this imply that imagery can be used to
solve problems in athletic performance?  To invent new athletic
equipment?

<li><em>Categories of movement.</em> We learned that natural
categories have vertical and horizontal structure.  Movements might
have vertical and horizontal structure like other natural categories.
E.g., basic level tennis swing is a forearm; subordinate categories
would be a forearm with topspin or a forearm with bottomspin;
superordinate might be horizontal stroke (as opposed to overhead
stroke like a serve).  This might imply that within categories of
movement, maybe prototypical movements are more easily imagined than
atypical movements.

<li><em>Hierarchical organization.</em> We learned that using
knowledge that is hierarchically organized takes different amounts of
time, depending on where information is in the hierarchy.  If
knowledge of body parts or of the sporting event is organized
hierarchically, does this imply that when imagining aspects of the
body or of the sporting event, different parts might be accessed via a
hierarchical organization of information?  For example, knowledge of
body parts might be organized hierarchically (body = head + non-head;
non-head = torso + arms + legs; arms = upper arm + forearm + hand;
hand = palm + fingers + thumb; etc.), so accessing information about
them, and generating images of them, might be constrained by that
hierarchical structure, as in sentence-verification experiments.

<li><em>Detail generation in imagery.</em> Kosslyn showed that images
can be zoomed in or out, with varying degrees of detail.  This implies
that athletes can focus on particular body parts or on the whole
event, and that zooming in and out should take time.

<h2>
Common problems in application papers.
</h2>


You <em>should</em> mark explicitly the organization of your paper.
Sections headers should be something like "Summary of Real-Life
Situation," "Links to Course Material," "Implications of Course
Material for the Real-Life Situation," and "References") so that I can
see what you are doing where. <p>

<strong>Common problems regarding the article summary:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Not indicating when you are summarizing and when you are drawing
your own conclusions or interpreting.

<li>Not defining terminology you take from the article.

<li>Not indicating the source you are summarizing.

<li>Not mentioning a clearly relevant point from the article (i.e.,
making the summary a little <em>too</em> brief).

</ul>

<strong>Common problems regarding links to course topics:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Mentioning only a few of the possible links, and/or missing some
obvious and strong ones.

<li>Describing class topics "from thin air" and not clearly explaining
the link to the article.

<li>Interpreting a class topic incorrectly.

</ul>

<strong>Common problems regarding implications from class topics to
the real-world situation:</strong>

<ul>

<li> Discussing something other than implications from class material
to the real-life situation.  The goal of the implications section is
to discuss various theories and phenomena in class and find
implications for the real-life situation that are not explicitly
discussed.  E.g., for pattern recognition, we know from class that
context is important.  Does the real-life article discuss the role of
context, and if not, how could context play a role? As another
example, for the topic of attention, we know that distracted attention
can lead to illusory conjunctions or misperceived shape.  Does that
occur in the real-life situation or could it?  Etc., etc.
<strong><em>In writing this section, go through the topics discussed
in class and textbook, and see what they imply for the real-life
situation.</em></strong>

<li> Missing some strong or obvious implications.

<li> Interpreting a class topic incorrectly.

</ul>

<strong>Common problems regarding citation and source:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Incomplete citation.  You must give the complete and explicit
citation: Author, date, article title, newspaper or magazine title,
and page numbers.  For Web items, give the complete URL.

<li>Not using an item from the popular press.  The assignment
explicitly asks for articles from the popular press, not from academic
journals.  Academic articles (for which the authors are not paid,
there are no advertisements, and articles are peer reviewed) can be
used for reference, but should NOT be the primary target of your
paper.  The articles should discuss real-life applications, not just
laboratory experiments.

</ul>
