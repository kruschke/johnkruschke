<p>Keeping your knowledge <em>organized</em> is crucial for
understanding and for remembering.  The time you spend figuring
out how it all fits together will pay off in terms of
performance on exams and in terms of your enjoyment of the
class!

<p>To help digest the readings, it's crucial always to keep in
mind the "big picture" --- <em>why</em> is the author
discussing this particular thing in this particular place?
What point is it supposed to be illustrating or demonstrating?
Be sure you can answer this question; if you can't, then you
don't really understand!

<p>The knowledge organization diagram from the syllabus is
intended to help you keep the big picture.  Whenever you read
about an experiment in the book, or hear about one in lecture,
you should be able to fill in all the leaves of the knowledge
organization tree.  Sometimes an experment is discussed in
terms of its results only, without a theory thoroughly
described.  In these cases, you should at least be aware that
if a theory were proposed, it would have to specify
representation and process.

</pre>

<p>The Carpenter & Daneman model addresses word-by-word integration of
meaning.  The Kintsch model addresses phrase-by-phrase or
sentence-by-sentence integration of meaning.  The two models have a
lot in common, in that they both address how meaning is integrated
from one unit (word or sentence) to the next.  But they also differ in
some details, of course.  Does the word-integration model do
reinstatement searches?  Does the text-comprehension model have error
recovery heuristics?

<p><em>Saccades</em> are just rapid movements of the eyes between
fixations.  When people read, their eyes move in a series of rapid
jumps (saccades) and stops (fixations), not in a smooth flow.

<p>Regarding integration in text comprehension again...  You should
know how Kintsch's model addresses the three factors that affect
integration.  You should also know the basic processes in the model,
including, but not necessarily only, the construction-integration
cycle described in lecture, and the various ways that the model tries
to achieve integration using STM, inference, reinstatement search,
etc.

</pre>

<p>Don't worry about the difference in terminology.  They're really
just different labels for the same thing.


<a name="integration"><p><hr></a>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>The direct and "less direct" ways of keeing information active in
STM are really not that different.  The direct way simply has the very
same words or concepts repeated in consecutive sentences.  The
indirect way has the same schema or <em>mental model</em> maintained
in consecutive sentences, without explicit repetition of the concepts.
Both cases lead to the same conclusion: Comprehension is better when
relevant preceding information is still active in STM.

<a name="avail"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> I also have a question regarding the last essay topic on the review

> mistake of thinking there are more women than men in the Famous Names
> Experiment.  And are you refering to the Wright and Bower
> experiment(1992) when you mention the influence of mood and
> probability estimates?

> could you please review whatyou want us to know about the famous names 
> experiment from lecture?  thanks for your time,
</pre>

<p>The availability heuristic states that people try to generate
examples of an event in order to estimate the probability of an event.
The more examples they can come up with, the higher the probability
estimate.

<p>For the famous names experiment, the famous names are easier to
remember.  So when estimating the probability (or proportion) of women
in the list, the people actually are remembering the famous names, and
the list happened to have more famous women than famous men, even
though the list had more men overall.

<p>Yes, the "mood" topic does refer to Wright & Bower (p. 424).

<p>What should you know about the famous names experiment?  Know the
four leaves of the <a href="syllabus.html#exams">knowledge
organization diagram</a> (although in less detail than usual since we
did not dwell on this in class).  Know the basic procedure and task,
and the result. We did not discuss the independent variables in class,
although you can deduce that one I.V. was the proportion of women's
names and another was the proportion of <em>famous</em> women's names.
Then know the basic explanation in terms of the availability
heuristic.  This explanation emphasizes process, and does not specify
much about representation.

</pre>

<p>It's difficult for me to write a long discussion of every one of
these topics; I'll just provide some pointers.  Please <A
HREF=mailto:KRUSCHKE@indiana.edu>e-mail me</a> again if you have more
specific questions.

<p><em>Medical diagnosis.</em> (pp. 433-435) What was "one of the
major findings" of this study?  What was "a central issue"?  (The
phrases are in quotes because the book uses them exactly.)

<p><em>Schemas in language comprehension.</em> This is a very broad
topic and was discussed in several chapters of the textbook.  It was
first brought up on pp. 278-285 of Chapter 9, and then similar issues
were discusses throughout Chapters 10 and 11.  For example, see Figure
11.1, p.327.

<p><em>Logic of science.</em> Science can only deny the consequent;
i.e., it can only prove that theories are wrong in some way.  Science
cannot prove that a theory is correct (that is, affirming the consequent
- confirming a prediction - doesn't prove that the theory is correct).

<p><em>Feelings in decision making.</em> This was discussed in
lecture.  There were at least two main points.  First, it is not
always easy to verbalize our feelings about a decision, yet some
decisions depend crucially on feelings.  For example, selecting a
picture to hang on our wall depends on difficult-to-justify gut
feelings.  Second, people with specific brain damage, that insulates
them from their feelings, do not make very good decisions, even in
"pure reasoning" situations.  It seems that these people don't have
the emotional links necessary for properly acting upon a choice.

<p><em>Means-end analysis and hill climbing.</em> Both of these are
heuristics for problem solving.  Means-end analysis tries to solve
problems by analyzing sub-goals and solving the sub-goals.  Means-end
analysis can get stuck if a sub-problem can't be solved with the
available operators.  Hill-climbing is another heuristic, which tries
to solve problems by getting closer to the goal.  Hill-climbing can
get stuck if the true solution path requires a detour farther away
from the goal.


<a name="logicsci"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> I was going over the exam four review sheet for P335 recently and was 
> confounded by the propositional reasoning and logic of science question 
> topic under the multiple choice (#15). Did we discuss this in class? I have 
> attended every class and can't find it in my notes.
> Thanks,
</pre>

<p>This was discussed in class, along with the topic of conditional
reasoning, after the Wason card selection task.  Science can only deny
the consequent; i.e., it can only prove that theories are wrong in
some way.  Science cannot prove that a theory is correct (that is,
affirming the consequent - confirming a prediction - doesn't prove
that the theory is correct).
