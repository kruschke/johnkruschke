<p>Exam 2 Results
</h2>
</center>

<p>Some common problems on the exam:
<ul>

<li>Be careful to answer everything that's asked for and only what's
asked for.  If it asks for theory, don't go into great length about
experiments, and vice-versa.  It it asks to describe an experiment, be
sure to state the I.V.'s and D.V.'s, etc.  If it asks to describe two
conditions, then be sure to describe both conditions.

<li>It can help tremendously to sketch a graph of results (properly
labelled!) in your answer, for two reasons: 1. It is a terrific memory
aid for you (as we'll learn, images are remembered very well).  2. It
is a concise way to communicate to the exam grader that you really
know the results!  On the other hand, don't just draw the graph
without also explicitly describing the I.V.'s and D.V., etc.

<li>In describing release from P.I., many people did not state that
memory on the first trial was nearly perfect.  Also in describing
release from P.I., many people did not say that the main implication
was that STM cannot be purely acoustic.

<li>In describing results from the Loftus experiment on the influence
of questions after witnessing an event, many people left out important
details, such as the fact that performance was negatively affected by
inconsistent questions even immediately after viewing the event.

<li>Many people didn't correctly answer one part of the question
regarding Craik and Tulving's depth of processing experiment, namely,
why words which were answered with "yes" were recalled better than
words which were answered with "no".  A few people confused the "depth
of processing" experiment with the experiment on elaboration within a
level of processing.

<p>Individual scores are reported below, sorted by the last four
digits of your student ID number.  Please verify that our recorded
scores match the correct scores on your exams!

<p>If your score on Exam 2 was less than Exam 1, it doesn't
necessarily mean you did worse relative to the rest of the class.  As
indicated above, there was a mean decline of 4.3 points, so that if
your score declined less than 4.3 points, you're actually doing better
than you did on Exam 1, relatively speaking.
