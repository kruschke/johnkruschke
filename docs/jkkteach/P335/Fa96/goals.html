diagram</a> for the course, and goals regarding learning about
real-world applications and laboratory experiments.

<li>Understand Kruschke's definition of cognitive psychology.

<li>Understand notions of representation and process in theories of

<a href="patternrecog.html">pattern recognition</a>.

importantly, understand how the experiments and theories fit into the
"knowledge organization" diagram for the course.

<li><a href="patternrecog.html">pattern recognition</a> is not just
"bottom-up:" Top-down context effects in letter recognition and face
perception.  Experiments and theories of each, and how they fit into
the knowledge-organization diagram.

</ul>


<a name="wk3"></a> <dt><strong>Week 3: <a
href="patternrecog.html">Pattern Recognition</a> and Attention.
</strong> <dd><ul>

of attention.

<li>Exam.  As described in the <a
href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, a <a

<a name="wk5"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 5: STM and LTM</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the classic experiments of Peterson & Peterson (1959)
and of Waugh & Norman (1965) regarding duration of STM and cause of
forgetting in STM, respectively.

<li>Understand the notion of "chunking" and the capacity of STM.

<li>Understand the difference between expert and novice performance in
STM tasks.

<li>Understand experiments and models of scanning STM.

</ul>

<a name="wk6"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 6: more STM and LTM</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Understand the distinctions between STM and LTM and evidence for
and against the distinction.  (Including changes of serial position
effects and release from proactive inhibition.)

<li>Understand various memory deficits resulting from different types
of brain damage, and implications for functional theories of memory
(for example, anterograde amnesia might be explained by selective loss
of transfer from STM to LTM).  Understand indirect versus direct tests
of memory.

</ul>

<a name="wk7"></a> <dt><strong>Week 7: Three pervasive themes in memory</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li><em>THEME: Events can be coded in different ways, and we tend to
remember the coding, not exactly the original event.</em> For example,
depth of processing and elaboration.

<li><em>THEME: Memorization associates events with their external and
internal context</em>.  External and internal context of memory:
Encoding specificity and state dependency.

<li><em>THEME: Memory is reconstructive.</em> It uses context and
schemas to reconstruct the most likely event, and it can lose info
regarding the source of the event.  For example, eye-witness memory,
and false repressed memories.

</ul>

<a name="wk8"></a>
<dt><strong>Week 8: Imagery</strong>
<dd><ul>

<li>Exam.  As described in the <a
href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, a <a
href="syllabus.html#exams">goal of the exam</a> is to emphasize the
lower levels of the knowledge organization diagram, whereas a <a
href="syllabus.html#applications">goal of the applications paper</a>
is to emphasize the upper-middle level.

<li><a href="exam2.html">Exam 2 review topics.</a>

<li>Understand some basic phenomena of imagery, including mental
rotation, cognitive map heuristics, effects of image size, and
interference between imagery and perception (within a modality).  The
goal is to understand the effects themselves; <em>theories for
explaining the effects</em> are discussed later.

<li>Know experiments demonstrating that imagery is easier to remember
than words.

<li>Know that <em>interactive</em> imagery is especially good for
remembering associations.  Applications to advertising, face and name
memory.  Interactive imagery can also act as an insulating context
against other retrieval cues.

<li>Understand the difference between <a
href="mazemodels.html">propositional and analogue representations in
explanations of mental imagery</a>.  Understand that both theories are
applicable to various situations. <a

(c.1965) of grammar: Phrase-structure rules (process) generate
deep-structure (representation), and transformation rules (process)
generate surface structure (representation).

<li>Know some of the empirical evidence for and against Chomsky's
standard theory as a theory of human language processing
(psycholinguistics).
