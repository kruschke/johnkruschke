<p>Keeping your knowledge <em>organized</em> is crucial for
understanding and for remembering.  The time you spend figuring
out how it all fits together will pay off in terms of
performance on exams and in terms of your enjoyment of the
class!

<p>To help digest the readings, it's crucial always to keep in
mind the "big picture" --- <em>why</em> is the author
discussing this particular thing in this particular place?
What point is it supposed to be illustrating or demonstrating?
Be sure you can answer this question; if you can't, then you
don't really understand!

<p>The knowledge organization diagram from the syllabus is
intended to help you keep the big picture.  Whenever you read
about an experiment in the book, or hear about one in lecture,
you should be able to fill in all the leaves of the knowledge
organization tree.  Sometimes an experment is discussed in
terms of its results only, without a theory thoroughly
described.  In these cases, you should at least be aware that
if a theory were proposed, it would have to specify
representation and process.

</pre>

<p>The experimental fact to be explained is that people (and rats)
take a more direct route on the second run than the first.  This is
all that is being emphasized in this particular demo.

<p>Then comes the issue of how to explain this result.  What is going
on in people's minds that underlies this learning?  In the explanation
that posits analogue representation, the first run builds up a
cognitive map (this is a <em>process</em> of learning), and the second
run scans the map (again a <em>process</em>) before actually moving.
The representations and processes are listed in a <a
href="mazemodels.html">web-linked table</a>.

</pre>

<p>Check out Box 7.1 (pp.202-203) of the textbook, entitled "Mental
images help athletes train their bodies".  You should read about what
sorts of mental imagery are beneficial, and what sorts are
detrimental.

<p>There is also a <a href="app1.html#example">sample applications
paper on this topic</a>.

</pre>

<p>I am referring to strategies such as "conservative focussing",
discussed in class.  This particular stategy is effective when you
know that the rule is a conjunctive rule, and all you have to do is
discover the relevant attributes (referred to as "attribute learning"
on p.224 of the textbook).


<a name="science"><p><hr></a>

<pre> 
> How exactly is conservatice focussing NOT like a science.
> My notes weren't really clear on this topic.  
</pre>

<p>In scientific method, the goal is to discover what factors are
causally related to an outcome (and in what manner they are related to
an outcome).  We don't know in advance what factors will have an
effect, and we don't know in advance how the factors combine to
produce the effect.  We don't know in advance what kind of "rule"
produces the outcome, and in particular, we don't know that a
conjunctive rule will work; the factors might instead interact in
complex ways.  Therefore conservative focussing will not suffice as a
strategy to figure out which factors are relevant to an effect.
Instead, we must exhaustively explore various combinations of levels
of factors, to map out any possible complex interactions.


<a name="featlap"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> Hi I have a couple of questions.

> Thanks
</pre>

<p>This is really just another perspective on the feature-listing
experiment of Rosch.  The idea is that members of a super-ordinate
category (e.g. chair, table, sofa as members of furniture) have
relatively few overlapping features, but members of a basic level
category (e.g., desk chair, dining room chair, living room chair as
members of chair) have relatively numerous overlapping features.
Members of subordinate categories also have many overlapping features.


<a name="pictid"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> does rosch's shape identification expt refer to the expt about
> furniture in the book? thanks.

> Hi I have a couple of questions.
> ...
> What is the shape identification experiment?
> Thanks
</pre>

<p>Either one will do for the exam.  The point I wish to emphasize
with these experiments is <em>evidence for a basic level in
categorization</em>.  

<p>Thus, for the category-verification experiment (see a picture and
verify that it is an instance of furniture, or of a chair, or of a
living-room chair), RT's were fastest at the basic level.

<p>For the outline-identification experiment (see an outline and try
to say what it is a picture of), identification of average shapes was
better for the basic level than the super-ordinate: The average chair
(basic level) is identifiable as a chair; the average piece of
furniture (super-ordinate level) is not identifiable as furniture.


<a name="priming"><p><hr></a>

<pre>
> Professor Kruschke-

</pre>

<p>Semantic associate priming is described on p.272.  This involves
"lexical verification" (as opposed to sentence verification).  Each
trial has two successive words (or non-words), and verifying the
second can be facilitated if it is meaningfully related to the first.

<p>Path priming is described on p.266: "Collins and Quillian proposed
that the degree of facilitation should depend on whether one follows
the same path in the network to answer the two questions."  In
verifying two successive sentences, the second verification should be
facilitated if it uses some of the same path as the first
verification.

<p>Aside from the difference between tasks (sentence verification
vs. lexical verification), there are differences in the types of links
assumed by the models.  The hierarchical model only assumes "is-a"
links and "property" links.  The spreading activation models assumes
various types of weighted connections between any related concepts
(such as bread and butter).

<a name="integration"><p><hr></a>

<pre>

> Thank you so much for clearing up these concepts
</pre>

<p>I think the key summary sentence is on p.278, 4th paragraph: "The
revision [in ACT] is simply that activation can stop at a subnode
rather than spread to the integrated facts linked to that subnode."
So factual inferences can be fast in ACT because responses can be
generated as soon as subnodes are activated, rather than waiting for
activation to spread to all the constituent facts.
