<h2><center>Brief Overview of Lectures on Pattern
Recognition</center></h2>

<p><strong>Real-Life Phenomena: Constancies and Context
Effects.</strong> Any complete theory of human pattern recognition
must account for both <em>constancies</em> and <em>context
effects</em>.  A "constancy" is a constant percept despite changes in
the stimulus.  For example, we recognize both <small>A</small> and
<font size=+2>A</font> as the same (constant) letter, despite changes
in size.  A "context effect" is a change in the percept depending on
the context.  For example, the symbol /-\ can be seen as an A or an H
depending on context:<br>T/-\E C/-\T

<p>Thus, what we perceive is always an (unconscious) inference about
what is probably out there in the world, based on the ambiguous
information arriving at our sensory surfaces.  This fact is also
illustrated by ambiguous figures and illusions.

<p><strong>Applications:</strong> Computers can recognize some
patterns, but most are very constrained in their abilities.  What
makes human pattern recognition so much richer?

<p><IMG SRC="knoworgbot.gif" align=left alt="knowledge organization

Structural Relations.</strong> The lectures spent a lot of time
describing how experiments fit into the knowledge organization diagram
at left.  We discussed experimental evidence for the existence of
templates, feature lists, and structural relations in human pattern
recognition.

<p><em>One of the main goals of these early lectures was to give you
several thorough examples of the knowledge organization tree, so you
can apply it yourself when learning about other experiments.</em>

<p><strong>Context Effects:</strong> "Bottom-up" context effects occur
despite any knowledge of the observer.  For example, a diamond inside
a tilted rectangle looks like a tilted square, regardless of any
knowledge about geometric objects.  "Top-down" context effects depend
on the observer's knowledge.  An example is the word superiority effect
in letter recognition.

<p>Context effects should not be construed as perceptual errors or
infelicities; instead, the human visual system often achieves its
constancies by taking advantage of the rich informational constraints
supplied from context.  For example, in lecture I showed the cover of
the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's, which has a crowd of faces on it.
A computer program failed to detect many faces and falsely recognized
some elbows as faces.  People don't make those mistakes because we use
the context to influence recognition.
