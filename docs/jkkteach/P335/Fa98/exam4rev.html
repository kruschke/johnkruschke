<h2>Exam 4 Review Topics, Fall '98
</h2>


<p>NOTICE: For this exam, there will not be any essay questions.
Instead, there will be a number of "fill in the blank" questions in
addition to the usual multiple choice questions.  The exam will have
75 points total possible, with approximately 55 of the points from
multiple choice, as in the previous exams.

<ul>

<li>General framework for defining a problem, and examples (start,
goal, operators, contraints; lecture).

<li>Deep Blue, Shallow Red, and computer problem solving vs. human
problem solving (lecture, see also pp. 364-365).

<li>Greeno's three types of problems and examples of each
(arrangement, structure induction, transformation; pp. 354-361).

<li>Representational desiderata for problem solving (lecture).

<li>Problem solving heuristics: means-ends analysis, subgoals,
hill-climbing, working backwards, and analogy (lecture and pp. 365-380).

<li>Experimental evidence for human use of hill-climbing in
problem solving (lecture - the Calvin and Hobbes problem, aka the
Missionaries and Cannibals problem).

<li>Analogical transfer, representational transfer, and applying prior
knowledge in problem solving (pp. 372-380, 390-391).  At least two
questions on these topics.

<li>Wason card selection task: In its abstract form, which cards are
correct and what error do people tend to make? (lecture, WWW,
pp. 387-390).

<li>Wason card selection task: Four solution strategies that people
might use (lecture, WWW, pp. 387-390).

<li>Expertise and sensitivity to underlying structure in problems
(pp. 392-394).

<li>Effect of examples on creativity (pp. 402-404).

<li>The four conditions in Finke's studies of creative invention, and
which conditions were most productive (pp. 404-405).

<li>Decision making heuristics: Representativeness, availability,
anchoring and adjustment (lecture and pp. 421-426).

<li>Framing effects (lecture and pp. 426-430).

<li>Expected value and expected utility (lecture and pp. 427-430).

<li>Information integration and the additive model (homework).

<li>Compensatory and non-compensatory processes in making choices, and
how to tell which ones people are using (lecture and pp.414-421).

<li>Stategies in decision making that depend on problem complexity, as
studied by Payne (pp. 419-421).

<li>Disease diagnosis by physicians: hypothesis generation,
evaluation, and final diagnosis (pp.433-435).

<li>Role of feelings in decision making (lecture and WWW re: Phineas
Gage).

<li>What are three possible ways of getting "common sense" into a
computer/robot? (video and web notes re: video).
