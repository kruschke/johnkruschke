<p>You will see pairs of personal characteristics of a hypothetical
person. For each pair of characteristics, you must assign a rating of
likability.  One characteristic will be either "level-headed",
"unsophisticated" or "ungrateful", and the other characteristic will
be either "good-natured", "bold" or "humorless".  You give the pair a
rating on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 means unlikable and 9 means
likable.

<p>Use the entire rating scale, from 1 to 9.  Don't just give every
combination about the same rating.  For example, you will probably
want to give "level-headed" and "good-natured" the highest rating (9),
and give "ungrateful" and "humorless" the lowest rating (1).  But this
is merely a guideline, not a requirement, and there are no right or
wrong answers.  Give each combination the rating that seems
appropriate to you, while trying to use the entire rating scale from 1
to 9.

<p>You will see four pages of nine pairs per page.  After you have
made your ratings, your data will be shown to you, as will the model
we will test.
