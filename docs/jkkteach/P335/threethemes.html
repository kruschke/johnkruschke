<H2 align=center><strong>Three Themes of Memory</strong></H2>


<OL>

<p><font size=+1><strong><li> Selective Encoding and
Processing.</strong></font> 

<br>An event can be encoded and processed different ways.  We remember
our selective, interpreted encoding of the event, not the "pure"
external event itself.

<p>Examples:

<ul>

<li>Chunking in STM.

<li>Depth of processing experiments.

<li>Jacoby '83 experiment on implicit memory and indirect tests.

<li>Transfer appropriate processing.

<li>Blocking of associative learning, in Homework 2.

<li>...

</ul>

<p><font size=+1><strong><li> Bound to Context.</strong></font>

<br>Memory tends to associate events with their external context and
with our internal state, but this link to context can be weak or lost.

<p>Examples:

<ul>

<li>Encoding specificity experiments.

<li>The cognitive interview.

<li>...

</ul>


<p><font size=+1><strong><li> Retrieval is Inferential
Reconstruction.</strong></font> 

<br>Memory is reconstructive: It uses context and knowledge structures
(schemas) to reconstruct the seemingly most likely event from an
imperfect and ambiguous trace in memory.

<p>Examples:

<ul>

<li>False memories of words in lists.

<li>Suggested or induced memories of being kidnapped, therapy-induced
memories of abuse, etc.

<li>Memories affected by subsequent information; e.g. E. Loftus
experiments.

<li>Schematization of memories (this might also take place at encoding).

<li>...

</ul>
