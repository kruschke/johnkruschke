<h2>
P335 Cognitive Psychology, Prof. Kruschke
<br>Homework Assignment Evaluation Form
<p>What do <em>you</em> think about this assignment?
</h2>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, one of
the goals of this course is for you to better understand theories and
their relation to data in cognitive psychology.  The homework
assignments are designed to help you achieve this goal.

<p>Please tell Professor Kruschke whether this assignment achieved
this goal, by filling out the form below.  Although your evaluation is
not anonymous, the content of your reply has no impact on your grade
whatsoever.  Your sincere evaluation will help improve future
assignments, and you get 2 points for your effort (just once per
assignment, of course).

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The earliest that may submit an
evaluation of a homework assignment is the day that it is due.  The
latest you may submit an evaluation is the exam day of the
corresponding quarter of the class.  You may not submit (for credit)
an evaluation of an assignment before the day it is due, or after day
of the corresponding exam.  But you are always welcome to <a
href=mailto:kruschke@indiana.edu>e-mail Professor Kruschke</a>
anytime.
