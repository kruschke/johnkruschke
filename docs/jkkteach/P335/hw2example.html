<h2>
<p>Example of Model Calculations for Homework 2
</h2>
</center>

Figure 1 (below) illustrates the calculations for activation
propagation and weight learning in the model of Homework 2.  <em>The
three training trials are <strong>not</strong> exactly the same
sequence as in your homework, so the numerical values are not
necessarily the same as what you should obtain in your homework.  This
example is intended to explicitly demonstrate the type of calculations
you should do.</em>

<p>For Training Trial 1, notice that all the weights start at zero,
and the predicted activations are therefore both zero.

<p>For Training Trial 2, the weight from <em>stiff neck</em> to A is
now .5 because the learning from Trial 1 increased the weight from 0
to .5.  Notice that the learning on this trial causes weights from
both <em>stiff neck</em> and from <em>pallid skin</em> to increase by
.25 because both of these symptoms are present.  They increase by .25
because lrate*(t<sub>A</sub>-a<sub>A</sub>)*a<sub>s</sub> =
.5*(1-.5)*1 = .25.

<p>For Training Trial 3, the weights to B start at 0, because nothing
has been learned about B yet.  Both weights increase by .5 as a result
of this training trial.

<p>(On your homework, there are additional training trials like Trial
2 and Trial 3.  On these additional trials, the predicted activations
of the diseases exactly match the teacher values.  Consequently, there
is no more change in the weights.  If the learning rate were smaller
than .5, say .1, then it would take more learning trials until the
predicted activations matched the teaching values.)

<p>For the Testing Trial, <em>pallid skin</em> and <em>double
vision</em> are activated.  Notice that disease B is activated more
strongly than disease A because of the stronger weight from <em>double
vision</em> than from <em>pallid skin</em>.  There is no change in
weights on this trial because there is no teacher value provided.
