<p>Outstanding levels of performance in areas such as memory, chess,
sports or music are commonly ascribed to innate talent. Dr. David
Shanks of University College, London, England, describes evidence for
the role of deliberate practice in achieving these levels of
performance and questions the need for the notion of talent. This
"anti-nativist" hypothesis is also evaluated in the area of
intelligence, where, again, it appears that outstanding levels of
achievement may not be due to innate ability.</P></font>

<p><font size="+2" color="#FF8040">A</font>s a young man, Rajan
Mahadevan regularly amazed his friends in India with his exceptional
numerical memory. Eager to prove the superiority of his memory, and on
the advice of the editors of the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i>,
Rajan set himself the task of committing to memory as many of the
digits of pi as he could manage. The culmination of this effort came
on July 4th, 1981, when Rajan correctly recalled the first 31,811
digits of pi. It took nearly three hours at a rate of over three
digits per second, and was obviously thirsty work: according to
newspaper reports he had to pause after the first 10,000 digits for a
can of Pepsi. "Why did you stop at that particular point?" Rajan was
asked. "The 31,812th digit, I don't know why, I am always stumbling
over that one," he replied.

<br>
<p>To those of us who struggle to remember people's names or telephone
numbers, where we put our keys, and the things we have to do today,
Rajan's memory ability seems quite exceptional, and it is almost
impossible to avoid the inference that Rajan was born with a gift for
memory, some innate talent that later in life endowed him with a
memory well beyond the norm, in much the same way that Mozart was born
with a gift for music and Garry Kasparov with a gift for chess. Yet
recent research has begun to challenge the idea of giftedness or
talent as the basis for excellence in performance. Instead of
attributing Rajan's extraordinary memory abilities to nature, evidence
is now emerging that exceptional performance in memory, chess, music,
sports and other arenas can be fully accounted for on the basis of an
age-old adage: practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>To appreciate the extent to which memory capacity can be improved
by practice, consider some data collected by K. Anders Ericsson, then
at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and his
colleagues. Ericsson was interested in a memory capacity called digit
span. This refers to the number of digits that can be held in memory
when presented at a rate of one per second and which can then
immediately be recalled in the correct order. If read a six- or
seven-digit number, such as a telephone number, most people can
correctly recall the number from short-term memory. However, if the
number is eight or nine digits or more in length, correct recall
becomes extremely difficult. On the face of it, memory span would
appear to be a relatively fixed property of human memory, yet Ericsson
and his colleagues showed that span can be increased by practice up to
in excess of 100 digits. Ericsson trained two people, called SF and
DD, to improve their memory spans over many months of practice during
which they were given numerous digit sequences to memorize. At the
outset, both SF and DD had normal digit spans, but their spans
improved at a rate of about one digit for every two hours of
practice.</p>

<p>How was this improvement achieved? SF and DD were given no
particular guidance in how to improve their spans. However, SF was a
very good long-distance runner and had extensive knowledge of expected
times for different race distances. Thus when a digit sequence
included 3492, he encoded it as 3 min 49.2 sec, near world-record time
for the mile. It is obvious that with an encyclopedic knowledge of
running times, a long digit sequence can be more easily remembered if
it is translated into a smaller number of distinctly memorable running
times. DD was also a long-distance runner and used a method similar to
SF's, whereas a former winner of the World Memory Championships,
Dominic O'Brien, used a different method. </p>

<p>O'Brien's memory span, also in excess of 100 items, was based on
the classical "method of loci" originally attributed to the poet
Simonides of Ceos. Legend has it that Simonides was in the middle of
reciting a lengthy poem at a banquet when he was urgently called
outside. Just then, the roof of the banquet hall fell down, killing
everyone inside and mangling the bodies so badly that they couldn't be
recognized. However, Simonides was able to remember who had been
sitting at each place and so the bodies were identified. As the legend
suggests, the method of loci involves creating a series of mental
images in which each of a set of to-be-remembered objects is
visualized in a different place on a route. To recall the set, you
simply imagine yourself visiting all of the places on the route.</p>

<p>Although Rajan's extraordinary feat in memorizing pi is not
based on memory span but on storage in long-term memory, it is clear
that like SF and other mnemonists, Rajan relies very heavily on
mnemonic strategies that he has practiced extensively. Thus he
recognizes familiar patterns such as 312 as the area code for
Chicago. Moreover, after training specifically to improve his memory
span, SF became much faster at committing lengthy sequences of digits
to long-term memory, exactly the ability required by Rajan in
memorizing pi. Thus memory feats such as those demonstrated by Rajan
are enormously dependent on practice. Finally, and most importantly,
when tested on other forms of material such as prose passages or
complex geometrical shapes, Rajan's memory turns out to be
distinctly average.</p>

further digit span can be increased.</font></td></tr>

<P><center><b>PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE</b></center></P>

<p>No one would dispute that practice is an important component of
achieving exceptional levels of performance in music, chess, sports
and so on. After all, even the chess prodigy Bobby Fisher spent many
years immersed in chess strategy and tactics before becoming world
champion. But it is commonly assumed that both talent and practice are
needed to achieve renown, where talent refers to some innate
predisposition to make rapid advances in a particular field.</p>

<p>Yet evidence for the contribution of talent over and above practice
has proved extremely elusive. In another recent study, Ericsson and
his colleagues studied young pianists and violinists in their early
20s at the Music Academy of West Berlin, Germany. They asked the music
professors to nominate the best young musicians, those who they
thought had the potential for careers as international soloists, as
well as others whose potential they regarded as not quite so great,
and a third group who were most likely to become music
teachers. Hence, in terms of achievement, the first group comprises
the most exceptional musicians, the second group the next most
outstanding, and the last group the least exceptional.</p>

<p>If "talent" is the primary factor, we might assume that these three
groups differ in their innate giftedness for music and that this
explains their different levels of achievement. If a person is
innately gifted, then he or she can very rapidly attain an outstanding
level of performance once the basic skills and knowledge required have
been mastered. Yet Ericsson and his colleagues obtained a surprising
finding: the best musicians had simply practiced more across their
lives than the next best ones, who in turn had practiced more than the
ones likely to become music teachers. Each of the musicians was asked
to estimate approximately how many hours a week they had practiced
each year since the outset of their musical training, and these
estimates yielded cumulative totals of about 10,000 hours for the best
musicians, followed by 8,000 for the next best ones and 5,000 for the
least accomplished. The musicians also kept diaries for a week,
recording their exact amounts of practice, and these yielded
comparable differences, suggesting that the retrospective estimates
were roughly accurate.</p>

quintessential child prodigy, whose achievements are attributable to
natural giftedness, yet his early environment was hardly normal. His
father was himself an outstanding musician and exerted great pressure
on the young Wolfgang to develop his musical
abilities. </font></td></tr>

<br>
<p>The estimate of 10,000 hours from this study is interesting because
there is now abundant evidence across a range of abilities that
roughly this much practice is needed to achieve international levels
of performance. For instance, it has been estimated that about this
many hours of practice is usually completed between the time of first
learning the rules of chess and becoming an international
master. Ericsson has argued that similar amounts of practice are seen
in first-rate sportspeople, writers and scientists.</p>


<p>Two other lines of evidence converge on the conclusion that innate
talents play a minimal role in the development of exceptional
performance. First, if giftedness is important, then it ought to be
the case that children identified at an early age as having high
ability in a particular domain are exactly those children who go on
later to achieve high levels of accomplishment. If a child learning
the violin possesses an innate musical talent, this should be fairly
evident as soon as the child begins playing the instrument. In
contrast, if later ability is simply dependent on amount of
accumulated practice, there should be little or no relationship
between early signs of ability and later achievement.</p>

Review</i>, <b>100</b>, 363-406, (1993)). By the age of 20, the best
musicians at the Music Academy of West Berlin (as judged by the music
professors) had practiced for about 10,000 hours, the "good" ones for
about 8,000, and those trained to become teachers for about
5,000. Also shown are the data from a group of older professional
violinists. The results highlight the close relation between practice
and achievement.</font></td></tr> </table><br>

<p>To test these predictions, John Sloboda, Michael Howe and their
colleagues at the Unit for the Study of Musical Skill and Development
at the University of Keele, England, studied a large number of
children between 8 and 18, some of whom were sufficiently good
musicians to have won places at a selective music school. The
remainder were divided into further groups of differing musical
ability, with the least musical group comprising children who had been
relatively unsuccessful in learning an instrument, most giving up
after less than a year.</p>

<p>Sloboda, Howe and their colleagues then interviewed the parents of
these young musicians and tried to find evidence for early signs of
musical talent in those who later went to music school. Despite the
range of musical ability in the three groups, almost no differences
between them were found. Thus the most musically gifted young people
were reported to have first shown a liking for musical sounds at
around 1.9 years of age, but this was no younger than in any of the
other groups: for example, the children who went on to be unsuccessful
in learning an instrument first showed signs of liking musical sounds
at around 1.7 years of age. Similarly, there were no differences in
age of first making rhythmic or dance movements to music or of first
requesting involvement in musical activity. Only one characteristic,
the age at which the children first sang, appeared significantly
earlier in the most able group. However, even this is probably not
evidence of innate musical ability, since these children experienced a
greater degree of early musical input from their parents.</p>

<p>The second line of evidence suggesting that innate talents play a
minimal role in the development of exceptional performance concerns
the rate of improvement with practice. If talent or giftedness plays a
significant role over and above practice, then we would predict that a
talented individual would make more progress from a given amount of
practice than a less talented one. Surely the young Garry Kasparov
learned the complexities of a new chess opening in far less time than
it would take an average chess player? On the other hand, if practice
is essentially the only ingredient in the development of outstanding
ability, then talented and less talented individuals will require the
same amount of practice to progress by equal amounts.</p>

<p>The available evidence suggests that the latter of these
predictions is closer to the truth. Thus in a further study of their
young musicians, Sloboda, Howe and their colleagues asked them to
estimate how many hours of practice per day they had engaged in each
year since taking up their instrument, just as Ericsson and his
colleagues had done in their study. Since the musicians were regularly
taking musical grade exams, Sloboda, Howe and their colleagues were
able to use this as a measure of musical progress and could therefore
calculate the amount of practice that took place between successive
grades. The surprising result was that the most gifted children
required just as much practice as the less gifted ones: in fact, if
anything, there was a tendency for them to require more. For instance,
the most gifted group required on average 971 hours of cumulated
practice to reach Grade 4, while a less talented group took 656
hours. The high figure in the former group is boosted by a small
number of young people who practiced for exceptionally long periods of
time, but even when these individuals are excluded, there is still no
evidence that more gifted people can get by on less practice.</p>

<p>Overall, then, there is little evidence that talent contributes to
the achievement of exceptional levels of performance over and above
practice. Maybe we should dispense with the notion of talent
altogether?</p>

<P><center><b>THE NURTURE OF ABILITY</b></center></P>

<p>In the debate over nature versus nurture, it is clear that the
results obtained by Ericsson, Sloboda, Howe, and others strongly
emphasize the importance of nurture. The environment is dramatically
different for a child who practices a great deal and one who does
not. Yet it is not only in specific abilities such as memory, music,
chess, or sports that the effects of the environment can be seen. It
is now clear that even intelligence, that traditional favorite of
psychologists, can be dramatically influenced by changes in the
environment.</p>

<p>The most radical way to change the environment is to adopt a child
at birth from a household of low social and economic status (SES) to
one of high status, or vice versa. Christiane Capron and Michel Duyme
from the Université Paris V, France, searched adoption agency
records for children given up for adoption at birth and who were from
either high or low SES families and who were adopted by either high or
low SES families. They found overall that adoption into a high-SES
family compared to a low-SES one increased average intelligence, as
measured by intelligence quotient (IQ), by over 11 IQ points. Thus a
relatively extreme change of environment can have a significant impact
on "intelligence."</p>

<p>However, Capron and Duyme also found that regardless of the SES of
the adoptive family, children whose biological parents were of high
SES had IQs some 16 points higher than ones whose biological parents
were of low SES. Since the children were separated at birth from their
biological parents, it seems that the only way the biological parents
could influence the intelligence of their children is through
genes. Surely this indicates that intelligence is partly inherited?
And if that is the case, then might there not also be genetic factors
in memory, musical ability, and so on?</p>

<p>Some of the most compelling evidence for this suggestion comes from
studies of identical and non-identical twins. Identical twins (who are
called monozygotic, MZ) share 100 percent of their genes whereas
non-identical twins (called dizygotic, DZ) share only 50 percent of
their genes. If we measure memory, intelligence, or other abilities in
pairs of twins and if genes contribute to these abilities, then we
would expect the correlation between identical twins to be greater
than the correlation between non-identical twins. Since identical
twins are genetically identical, they should appear more similar in
abilities that have genetic components than non-identical twins. There
is now abundant evidence that this is true: in the case of memory
span, for instance, correlations are greater than 0.60 for monozygotic
twins compared to only about 0.20 for dizygotic twins.</p>

monozygotic (identical) twins can be either mono- or dichorionic. Thus
the prenatal environment tends to be more similar for identical than
for non-identical twins and this in turn might explain the higher
correlation of cognitive abilities in the former.</font></td></tr>
</table><br>

<P><center><b>WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WOMB?</b></center></P>

<p>But are such findings really evidence for innate talents? It must
be borne in mind that the MZ-DZ difference is evidence for a genetic
contribution to ability only if it can be convincingly argued that the
environment is as similar for a pair of DZ twins as it is for a pair
of MZ twins. Certainly, this will be the case with respect to
important factors such as the amount of intellectual stimulation the
parents provide: regardless of whether twins are MZ or DZ, the mental
stimulation they receive from their parents will be highly
similar. Moreover, it is known that the IQ correlation of same-sex and
different-sex DZ twins is virtually identical. The environment should
differ more for different-sex twins than for same-sex twins, but this
seems to make little difference in terms of the observed IQ
correlation.</p>

<p>Thus it is unlikely that differences in the post-natal environment
of MZ and DZ twins can explain the fact that MZ twins tend to be more
similar in ability. But what about the pre-natal environment? One
important question is whether or not the twins shared a chorion in the
womb. The chorion is part of the placenta and constitutes an important
ingredient of the pre-natal environment. A shared chorion implies a
shared blood supply and a higher probability of infections passing
between the twins.</p>

<p>Dizygotic twins are always dichorionic: each twin has his or her
own chorion. However, about 60 percent of MZ twins are monochorionic,
sharing a single chorion. This means that on average the pre-natal
environment is more similar for MZ than for DZ twins. Is it possible
that the greater similarity of MZ compared to DZ twins in terms of
mental ability is due to this? The critical test comes from
comparisons of dichorionic MZ and DZ twins. Such twins have roughly
comparable pre-natal environments, so if the MZ twins still show a
higher IQ correlation than the DZ twins, that would bolster the case
for a genetic contribution to ability. On the other hand, if such
twins are equally similar intellectually, that would suggest that the
standard MZ-DZ difference is largely due to the fact that some of the
MZ twins share a chorion, which makes them especially similar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, chorionicity is rarely measured in twin studies, and
researchers tend to lump together mono- and dichorionic MZ twins. But
in the one study to date which has compared IQ similarity in twins as
a function of their chorionicity, conducted in 1978 by Michael Melnick
and his colleagues at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland,
there was no difference in the correlation between white dichorionic
MZ and DZ twins. For these twins, environmental factors should be
highly comparable, and the only remaining difference is that the MZ
twins are more genetically similar than the DZ ones. The results of
this study suggest that genetic factors play only a minimal role in
mental ability, and that the inheritance of intelligence is very much
in doubt.</p>


<p>One problem with this study is that chorionicity is in fact very
hard to determine post-natally. However, James Davis and his
colleagues from the Southwest Missouri State University have recently
developed a technique for determining chorionicity in adult twins
which holds enormous promise for future research on the mental
abilities of twins. Davis' technique relies on the fact that
fingerprints are more similar in mono- than in dichorionic
twins. Although fingerprints are under fairly strong genetic control,
they are also influenced to a considerable extent by environmental
factors such as nutrition, infection, and the mother's health. When
twins share a chorion in the womb, they are about equally affected by
these environmental factors and thus their fingerprints look
similar. Dichorionic twins, on the other hand, experience more
distinct pre-natal environments and hence their fingerprints tend to
differ more.</p>

<p>The use of this technique in future twin studies should allow a
clearer picture to emerge of whether the similarity of identical twins
in terms of memory, intelligence, and so on is due to their shared
genetic endowment or instead to their shared pre- and post-natal
environment. It will be fascinating to see whether such research
confirms the emerging view that there is no such thing as "talent" or
"giftedness." To become an outstanding performer, one does not need an
innate endowment of the right sorts of genes; instead, one simply
needs to engage in deliberate practice for around 10,000 hours.</p>
