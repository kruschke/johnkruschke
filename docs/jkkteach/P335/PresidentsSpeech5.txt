words in proper places'. Prose, she found, might compensate, in
some degree; for lack of perceived tone or feeling.
In this way she was able to preserve, even enhance, the use of
'expressive' speech-in which the meaning was wholly given by
the apt choice and reference of words-despite being more and
more lost with 'evocative' speech (where meaning is wholly given
in the use and sense of tone).
Emily D. also listened, stony-faced, to the President's speech,
bringing to it a strange mixture of enhanced and defective percep-
tions---precisely the opposite. mixture to those of our aphasiacs. It
did not move her-no speech now moved her-and all that was
evocative, genuine or false completely passed her by. Deprived of
emotional reaction, was she then (like the rest of us) transported
or taken in? By no means. 'He is not cogent,' she said. 'He does
not speak good prose. His word-use is improper. Either he is brain-
damaged, or he has something to conceal.' Thus the President's
speech did not work for Emily D. either, due to her enhanced
sense of formal language use, propriety as prose, any more than
it worked for our aphasiacs, with their word-deafness but enhanced
sense of tone.
Here then was the paradox of the President's speech. We nor-
mals---aided, doubtless, by our wish to be fooied, were indeed
well and truly fooled ('Populus vult deciPi, ergo deciPiatur'). And
so cunningly was deceptive word-use combined with deceptive
tone, that only the brain-damaged remained intact, undeceived.
