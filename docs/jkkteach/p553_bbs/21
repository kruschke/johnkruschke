<P>
<P>&gt; Am I missing something on
<BR>&gt; problem #5, or does the mean=0
<BR>&gt; screw everything up on the calculations?
<BR>&gt;
<P>Compare this with the very similar #6 on p.294, which is answered in the back of the book.
<P>(If you're missing something, it's that "mu" is the null hypothesis mean, and "Predicted Mean" is the alternative hypothesis mean.)
