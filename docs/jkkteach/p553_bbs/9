<P>
<P>&gt; For #9, I'm not sure how one
<BR>&gt; would go about figuring out the
<BR>&gt; sample size based on a predicted
<BR>&gt; power of .2. I've tried using the
<BR>&gt; formulas you gave us in class to
<BR>&gt; answer this part of the question
<BR>&gt; as well, but i'm still pretty lost.
<P>Do study the web page, http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P553/power.html The two equations there give you everything you need.
<P>I'd like you all to study it a bit and try your hand at it. Please post discussion in reply to this message as you wish. Over the weekend or Monday I'll contibute some worked examples...
<P>&gt; After that, I'm guessing you want
<BR>&gt; us to decide whether to fund the
<BR>&gt; experiment based on some kind of
<BR>&gt; subjective view? (If we've got
<BR>&gt; no boundaries, can I just pretend
<BR>&gt; I own the world and fund anything
<BR>&gt; that comes my way???)
<P>The question, "Would you fund the proposal", is simply a restatement of the questions, Is there enough power in the proposed experiment if using the proposed sample size? Could the proposer reasonably get enough subjects to achieve enough power?
