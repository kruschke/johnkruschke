<P>I had several questions on homework #3. First, for #7, I'm assuming what you and the book are looking for is a statement acknowledging that if the N is larger, there's more of a chance that the null hypothesis is rejected, even though it was "true", (Type I error), and the null hypothesis being false is less likely, even though it's easier to reject. Is this what you're looking for?
<P>For #9, I'm not sure how one would go about figuring out the sample size based on a predicted power of .2. I've tried using the formulas you gave us in class to answer this part of the question as well, but i'm still pretty lost. After that, I'm guessing you want us to decide whether to fund the experiment based on some kind of subjective view? (If we've got no boundaries, can I just pretend I own the world and fund anything that comes my way???)
<P>Finally, #11. Put simply, huh??? I'm not even sure where to start...what exactly should we be putting into SPSS to generate necessary syntax files?
