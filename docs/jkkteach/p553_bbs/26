<P>Use the same logic as for distribution of mean samples.

<P>&gt; But, what's the logic reasoning
<BR>&gt; behind "In order to estimate
<BR>&gt; power forget that they are distribution
<BR>&gt; of st.dev. but treat them in the
<BR>&gt; same way as they are distribution
<BR>&gt; of sample means. " ? Thank
<BR>&gt; you!!
