<P>Well since the invite has been extended. Here are some answers and questions I wouldnt mind a little feedback on:
<P>Homework #1C - Determined Z Score to be 4.52 when r=300 and N=500 resulting in a power of 1.0 or 100%
<P>Homework #2 – Stupid question, but…This is a question simply for the chi square of independence, right?
<P>Homework #3A t-score of -1.724 was not severe enough to reject the null considering that tcrit=-2.447 (df=6)
<P>Homework #3D – Data Transformation via the square root does result in rejecting the null and having a significant reduction of BP. My t score = -2.559. Is that close?
<P>Homework #3E Rank order transformation also produced a significant result.
<P>Sample Final 1. Best Transformation: ln(x). This results in a not significant finding (t=-1.54; tcrit=2.447)
<P>1B. Data Transformation using Ranks: Also results in a not significant finding (t= -1.583)
<P>2B. Would the power be 14%
<P>2C Z score of 3.8, thereby resulting in ‘unfair’ ruling
<P>3A One can reject the null (assuming the question isn’t asking that the “3” makes the chi square table invalid); df=5, 11.071; Chi square=13.54
<P>thanks for any insights or corrections
<P>&gt; Because you will not be getting
<BR>&gt; any feedback about HW 12 before
<BR>&gt; the exam, you are invited to post
<BR>&gt; candidate answers -to the practice
<BR>&gt; exam also- on this web discussion
<BR>&gt; board. Please do respond to each
<BR>&gt; other's postings (don't just wait
<BR>&gt; for me or Nathan or Mario to reply).
<BR>&gt; Good luck!
