<P>In #3, it gives us the estimated standard variance, and then calls it 's'. So which is it? In other words, when pluging it into our formula of M-u/s/sqrtN, do we need to do the sqrt of S (as if it WAS a variance score), or can we just plug it in as our s? Sadly enough, I'm voting for the second, because I JUST managed to catch this, and unfortunately after I solved them without using the squareroot of s.
