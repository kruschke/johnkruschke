<P>Right. The book should have asked the question this way: "Are the lengths of English nouns, verbs and adjectives different?" (not which is longest).
<P>&gt; No t-test! Use F test (note
<BR>&gt; that you have three groups). So
<BR>&gt; you examine effect of word lenght
<BR>&gt; of three groups of words. If this
<BR>&gt; test is signitifican then there
<BR>&gt; is some notable differentce between
<BR>&gt; groups. You could use SPSS to do
<BR>&gt; the final job.
