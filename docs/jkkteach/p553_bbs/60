<P>#1 of HW 6 is now ready.
<P>Please be sure that you "re-load" the page in your web browser, so that you don't mistakenly get an old version.
<P>I'll explain in class why this took so long -- the problem is that Aron and Aron radically changed their discussion of effect size, from the 2nd edition to the 3rd edition, and I don't think the change was for the better.
<P>&gt; If you printed out HW 6 before
<BR>&gt; now, do not use it, as portions
<BR>&gt; of #1 are being changed. Stay tuned
<BR>&gt; for an announcement of when HW
<BR>&gt; 6 will be ready for your joyous
<BR>&gt; endeavoring.
