<P>
<BR>&gt; Finally, #11. Put simply,
<BR>&gt; huh??? I'm not even sure where
<BR>&gt; to start...what exactly should
<BR>&gt; we be putting into SPSS to generate
<BR>&gt; necessary syntax files?
<P>Perhaps you didn't see that a complete syntax file is already linked into the homework. Just click on the link in the homework.
<P>The SPSS program generates distributions of sample SD from two different uniform populations. From its output, you can get a pretty good estimate of power, if you understand what the program is doing and what the output is showing you.
