<P>Thanks Princess Leah for all of you insights. One question though. Isnt that light saber uncomfortable sitting at a desk using a calculator? I guess you could put on the desk, but wouldnt it fall off and get lost when Han Solo pulled an 8G turn. And finally what are you doing in our statistics class? You must have changed your hairstyle. I havent seen anybody with the hair donuts on their ears and long dresses. Good luck zapping bad guys!
<P>thanks again, a loyal subject from the republic
<P>&gt; here's my answers compared
<BR>&gt; to the answers you had:
<P>&gt; this is close to what I got,
<BR>&gt; t=-1.52
<P>&gt; yes that is what I got
<P>&gt; I think it would be 13.3%,
<BR>&gt; close to 14
<P>&gt; I got 3.74, so yes, it is
<BR>&gt; unfair
<P>&gt; right on.
