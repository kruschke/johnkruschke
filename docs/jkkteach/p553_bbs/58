<P>Everything on HW 6 is ready EXCEPT #1. Don't do #1 yet, but go ahead and take a look at the rest.
<P>&gt; If you printed out HW 6 before
<BR>&gt; now, do not use it, as portions
<BR>&gt; of #1 are being changed. Stay tuned
<BR>&gt; for an announcement of when HW
<BR>&gt; 6 will be ready for your joyous
<BR>&gt; endeavoring.
