<P>Sure, that'll do. Explain what the beta values mean (which you have to know in order to do the next exercise, anyway).
<P>&gt; In "briefly explain the
<BR>&gt; importance of each beta value under....",
<BR>&gt; is the correct answer something
<BR>&gt; as simple as describing the relationship
<BR>&gt; between beta and Y?
