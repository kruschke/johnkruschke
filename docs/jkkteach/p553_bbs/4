<P>If you have the 2nd edition of the textbook, instead of the 3rd, you might still be able use it for the course. I do not know yet how much of the text itself has changed since the 2nd edition because the 3rd edition appeared just a few weeks ago. The exercises have changed somewhat, however. Therefore you'll need to get the exercises from the 3rd edition. To do this, find a classmate a copy (or photocopy) the relevant exercises.
<P>I apologize to a few students with whom I spoke after class yesterday regarding the possibility of photocopying the relevant exercises before evening lab session. Obviously it didn't happen, but I hope that during lab you were able to get the exercises from classmates who have the 3rd edition.
