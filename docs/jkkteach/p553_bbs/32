<P>Actually, I really did intend the "after" column to be on the left and the "before" column to be on the right, as they are, because it's easier to subtract them when they are in that order, if doing it mentally. But thanks for checking.
<P>&gt; In #8, the rows go 'after,'
<BR>&gt; and then 'before'. I don't think
<BR>&gt; it matters much, but just in case,
<BR>&gt; I thought I'd mention it. Do you
<BR>&gt; want us to flip them around?
