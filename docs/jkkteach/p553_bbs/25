<P>Mean value of alternative distribution represents costs of the experiment (number of subject*mean number of correctly recognized items*value of..). Now you should investigate what would happen with the mean of alt. distribution when add more subjects and to calculate the costs of experiment again - for the new number of subjects.

<P>&gt; I have a question about #6,
<BR>&gt; about how much additional money
<BR>&gt; would the experimenter expect to
<BR>&gt; pay subjects for the increase in
<BR>&gt; power. Do we need to figure expected
<BR>&gt; value to figure the amount of money?
<BR>&gt; I am not sure what formula to use...
<BR>&gt; and I think I should probably not
<BR>&gt; rely on what common sense is telling
<BR>&gt; me. any suggestions? thanks.
