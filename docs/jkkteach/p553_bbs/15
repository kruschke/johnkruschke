<P>Hello, I wanted to ask if we are supposed to get the two-tailed conficence interval(CI) for the answer or just one-tailed one.
<P>For Homework 2, I performed a one-tailed Z-test in order to reject the null hypothesis. So I thought one-tailed CI should be used for this one. However, there was no examples of one-tailed CI I could find from my text book (maybe because it is the 2nd edition?)
<P>Can someone confirm this?
