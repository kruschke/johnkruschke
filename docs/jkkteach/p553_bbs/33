<P>Hmmm... That is confusing: S, as in the table, denotes the estimated standard *deviation*, but the text says "variance".
<P>By analogy to exercise #1 on p.332, the authors must mean *variance*, not deviation. That is, the table should have S^2 in its header, not S.
<P>&gt; In #3, it gives us the estimated
<BR>&gt; standard variance, and then calls
<BR>&gt; it 's'. So which is it? In other
<BR>&gt; words, when pluging it into our
<BR>&gt; formula of M-u/s/sqrtN, do we need
<BR>&gt; to do the sqrt of S (as if it WAS
<BR>&gt; a variance score), or can we just
<BR>&gt; plug it in as our s? Sadly enough,
<BR>&gt; I'm voting for the second, because
<BR>&gt; I JUST managed to catch this, and
<BR>&gt; unfortunately after I solved them
<BR>&gt; without using the squareroot of
<BR>&gt; s.
