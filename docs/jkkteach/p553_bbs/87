<P>&gt; 1. Can we use a calculator
<BR>&gt; to compute the standard deviation
<BR>&gt; (instead of doing it step-by-step
<BR>&gt; by hand) to save time?
<P>Yes, but you've got to know whether your calculator is using N or N-1 when it's computing the SD!
<P>&gt; 2. For the sample exam 2 (Q.3),
<BR>&gt; we've got r=0.8 but when I ran
<BR>&gt; a t-test, it turned out not significant.
<BR>&gt; Is it possible for such a huge
<BR>&gt; r to be insignificant? (maybe because
<BR>&gt; of the small sample size; N=4?)
<P>Yes, that's right.
<P>&gt; 3. Based on the Q. above -
<BR>&gt; do you want us to run a t-test
<BR>&gt; for finding if the r is significant
<BR>&gt; or not in the real test tomorrow?
<P>Yes, do. That is, convert r to t and compare with t_crit.
<P>
