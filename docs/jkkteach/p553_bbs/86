<P>1. Can we use a calculator to compute the standard deviation (instead of doing it step-by-step by hand) to save time?
<P>2. For the sample exam 2 (Q.3), we've got r=0.8 but when I ran a t-test, it turned out not significant. Is it possible for such a huge r to be insignificant? (maybe because of the small sample size; N=4?)
<P>3. Based on the Q. above - do you want us to run a t-test for finding if the r is significant or not in the real test tomorrow?
<P>Thank you for your time.
