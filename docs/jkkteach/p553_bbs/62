<P>I suggest to skip hom. of var. test in this problem. The data set is so artificial that SPSS does not want to deal it in a reguar way. So skip the test of homogeneity of variance in the problem #3. BUT, It will work in other questions.

<P>&gt; I'm having trouble displaying
<BR>&gt; the homogeneity of variance test
<BR>&gt; in SPSS for problem #3. When I
<BR>&gt; run the ANOVA, I get an error for
<BR>&gt; the homogeneity test. It says "test
<BR>&gt; of homogeneity of variances cannot
<BR>&gt; be performed for score of group
<BR>&gt; because the sum of caseweights
<BR>&gt; is less than the number of groups"
<BR>&gt; Any thoughts on what I can do to
<BR>&gt; correct this?
