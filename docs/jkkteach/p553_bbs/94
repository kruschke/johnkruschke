<P>If you would like to test whether obtained distribution of scores is normal you might use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is based on the largest absolute difference between the observed and the expected cumulative distributions.
<P>To use it go to: Analyze/NonParamtericTest/1-Sample-K-S
<P>There, choose your variable and check normal box. If K-S score is not significant (bottom of output) then the distribution is highly likely normal!
<P>You could try it and test your data in HMW#9 (optional but highly suggested).
<P>
