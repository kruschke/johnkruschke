<P>I have some doubt about the conclusion that the mean is larger than median in positive skewed distributions. I understand that mean is more sensitive to extreme outliers, but not all skewed distribtutions neccesarily have extreme outliers. I generated an example here: 1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8. In this positively skewed distribution, the mean is 4.7, but the median(the 18th score) is 5, which is lager than 4.7 (you can test my result in SPSS). So generally, how can we judge which one is lager in a positively skewed distribution without extreme outliers?
