<P>I guess I don't understand your question, but, for #3 and #4, i.e., #18 and #19 in the book, just do what the book asks for on only the data from from #15. That is, don't bother doing book problems #16 and #17.
<P>&gt; Hi - I just want to make sure
<BR>&gt; I am reading the homework instructions
<BR>&gt; correctly. Problems #3 & 4
<BR>&gt; refer to the problem we did in
<BR>&gt; question #2(both by hand and with
<BR>&gt; SPSS). Should we only be concerned
<BR>&gt; with doing the (i), (ii), (iii)
<BR>&gt; ,etc in problems 18 and 19 (in
<BR>&gt; the book).
<P>&gt; Sorry if this is pretty obvious
<BR>&gt; - but it seems a little less rigorous
<BR>&gt; than usual.
