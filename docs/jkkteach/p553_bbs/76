<P>I might not get to it until it's too late to be very useful. Meanwhile, all of you are invited to post candidate answers and discuss them. I'll also review a bit of the sample exam on Tuesday in class.
<P>&gt; Exam 2 is coming. I saw a
<BR>&gt; sample exam on the website, but
<BR>&gt; no answers. Can you post the answer
<BR>&gt; for this sample exam?
