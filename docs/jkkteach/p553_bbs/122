<P>I am somewhat puzzled with making the correction of continuity for this question.
<P>For N=500, I thought I needed to make this correction. However, what puzzles me is if I need to make this correction for both a & b, or just for b, when a & b are:
<P>a) calculating the Mcrit
<P>(1.96 = Mcrit - 250/sd)
<P>b) calculating the Z-score
<P>(Z = r-M/sd)
<P>...or, should I do not make any corrections to a and b?
