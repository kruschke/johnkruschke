<P>
<P>&gt; for #7, I'm
<BR>&gt; assuming what you and the book
<BR>&gt; are looking for is a statement
<BR>&gt; acknowledging that if the N is
<BR>&gt; larger, there's more of a chance
<BR>&gt; that the null hypothesis is rejected,
<BR>&gt; even though it was "true",
<BR>&gt; (Type I error), and the null hypothesis
<BR>&gt; being false is less likely, even
<BR>&gt; though it's easier to reject. Is
<BR>&gt; this what you're looking for?
<P>Some relevant pages in the book are 284-291. The question is basically asking you to interpret a marginally insignificant result when the sample size is large versus small.
