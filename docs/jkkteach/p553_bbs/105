<P>Greetings, all.
<P>Dubious that I'll be done grading your homeworks by a reasonable time tomorrow, I've opted to at least provide you with the correct answers for the homework by posting my excel key to the following address:
<P>http://php.indiana.edu/~nsteele/HW11.xls
<P>Please let me know if you have questions. I know some people had a lot of trouble figuring #s 1 and 6.
