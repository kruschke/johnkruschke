<P>Maybe I am a knucklehead, but I really couldnt figure out the graph for Question 1C (I did get the number of discrete possibilities however). Was it the same idea as question 1, Homework 11. If there are no make-ups or late final exams that need to be completed, I would greatly appreciate a brief discussion of what you were looking for. Thanks.
