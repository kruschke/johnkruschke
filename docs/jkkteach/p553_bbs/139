<P>
<P>&gt; Here is one very very very
<BR>&gt; useful link for statistical analysis!
<BR>&gt;
<P>&gt; http://members.aol.com/johnp71/javastat.html
<BR>&gt;
<P>&gt; You could perform most of
<BR>&gt; your class analysis using tools
<BR>&gt; that are available online! I would
<BR>&gt; suggest you to find section concerned
<BR>&gt; with power. (hint check out the
<BR>&gt; second link in that section).
