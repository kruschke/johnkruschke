<P>Because you will not be getting any feedback about HW 12 before the exam, you are invited to post candidate answers -to the practice exam also- on this web discussion board. Please do respond to each other's postings (don't just wait for me or Nathan or Mario to reply). Good luck!
<P>&gt; HW 12 is now ready for your
<BR>&gt; perusal. It covers the same topics
<BR>&gt; as will be on the final exam, so
<BR>&gt; it is a good review.
