<P>I received this today after class:
<P>"Just a reminder that instructors can not add students to their classes this week. Wait lists and adding the course are taken care of by the Registrar's Office. Some students have reported to the Advising Office that instructors have promised them space in their courses. We cannot exceed room capacity."
<P>So, hang in there, and we'll see what happens.
