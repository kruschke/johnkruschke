<p><font size="+1">This course is a tutorial introduction to doing
Bayesian statistics for data analysis.</font>

<p><b>Intended audience:</b> The course is aimed at graduate students
and advanced undergraduates.

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> <li>This is <i>not</i> a mathematical statistics
course, but a fair amount of mathematics is unavoidable. If you know
what someone means when she says, "The integral of x squared is
one-third x cubed," then you should be okay. You will not have to
<i>generate</i> a lot of mathematical derivations, but you will have
to <i>understand</i> some, and some will involve basic calculus. Later
topics might also involve linear algebra.  <li>We will be doing a lot
of programming (in a language called R). The road to understanding
will be much smoother if you have already had some programming
experience, in any language. It's easy to learn basic programming, but
it can be time consuming, so if you don't have any previous
experience, just anticipate spending more time. Learning to program
can have huge payoffs in multiple situations later in life, so it's
worth the effort. <li>A previous course in traditional statistics
(such as K300) or probability can be helpful as background. Although
the course will be developed independently of traditional ("null
hypothesis significance testing") statistical methods, you might find
the concepts of probability easier to understand if you have already
had some exposure to them.

<p><b>Materials:</b> The primary materials will be info delivered at
lecture and in course notes being written by the professor. Materials
will be posted on <a href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/"
target="new">Oncourse</a>. Please also discuss the assignments on <a
href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/" target="new">Oncourse</a>.  The
following textbooks are recommended other sources: <li>Albert and
Rossman. Workshop Statistics: Discovery with Data, a Bayesian
Approach. <br>The last few chapters of this book give a wonderfully
clear introduction to the basics of Bayesian statistics --- but only
the basics.  <li>Bolstad. Introduction to Bayesian Statistics.<br>
Terrific tutorial that uses only basic calculus; highly
recommended. Only down side is that it does not cover numerical
approximation methods.  <li>Gill. Bayesian Methods: A Social and
Behavioral Sciences Approach.  <br>and <li>Gelman, Carlin, Stern and
Rubin: Bayesian Data Analysis.  <br>These two books offer more
advanced examples of Bayesian methods, including Monte Carlo
techniques.


<p><b>Schedule:</b> This is a course in development, hence it is
offered as a one-time "seminar." This means that the exact schedule of
the course will be determined as we progress, in response to student
feedback. Updated schedule information will be posted online as we go.

<p><b>Grading; Homework; Exams:</b> There will be weekly homework
assignments. At this time I plan no exams nor any final
project. Grades will be determined by performance on the homework
assignments. All assignments are mandatory. There will be penalties
for late homework unless you have a cogent excuse. These penalties are
designed as an incentive to you because the material is cumulative;
the penalties also help keep things fair to all students. If you must
be late with an assignment, please let me know <i>immediately</i>.

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> All the information here is subject to
change. Changes will announced in class.
