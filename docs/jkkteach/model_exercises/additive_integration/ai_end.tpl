the two characteristics into a rating.  </td></tr>

<p><strong>An Additive Model of Information Integration.</strong>
Figure 1 (below) shows a flowchart for information integration.  It
starts with the two characteristics, on the left.  This pair of
characteristics is the physical stimulus.  When the characteristics
are perceived, they are mentally converted to <em>psychological
values</em>, denoted in the Figure 1 as "Psych. Value 1" and
"Psych. Value 2."  The flowchart shows that this conversion is done
<em>independently</em> for the two characteristics; for example, the model
asserts that the psychological value for "level-headed" is the same
regardless of whether the other characteristic is "good-natured" or
"humorless."

<p>Once these two psychological values have been
established, they are then <em>integrated</em> or combined into a single
psychological value (labelled "Integrated Psych. Value" in Figure 1).
The <em>additive</em> version of this model asserts that the
integrated psychological value is obtained by <em>adding</em> the two
individual psychological values.  Other versions of the model
hypothesize <em>multiplication</em> of values, or <em>averaging</em>,
or more complicated processes.  We will be investigating the additive
model.

<p>After the integrated psychological value is determined, it is
converted into an overt <em>rating</em>, i.e., the actual response.

<p>This theory makes certain claims about the representations and
processing involved in information integration.  In terms of
<em>representation</em>, it claims that the characteristics can be
represented as single values on a psychological scale.  The theory
makes no claims about what other representations, such as semantic
features, might generate these values.  Thus, the content of the
representation is just the scale values of the characteristics, and
the format of the representation is "metric," i.e., organization by
order and distance on a scale.  In terms of <em>processing</em>, the
theory asserts that the scale values are generated independently, and
that the integrated psychological value is obtained merely by adding
the two characteristic values.

<p>We want to find out whether this additive model fits your ratings.

<strong>Summarize your data.</strong> We need to get a better view
of your ratings.  For each combination of characteristics, compute
your mean rating and enter the means in Table 2.  For example,
in the top-left cell, that is, for the combination "level-headed" and
"good-natured," you should write the mean of [s111], [s112], [s113],
and [s114] (these were your four ratings of this combination).

<p><strong>Generate predictions of the model.</strong> Now that you
have a good picture of your data, you need to see how well the
additive model fits them.  <em>We need to determine the best estimate
of your psychological values for each of the characteristics.</em>  Refer
back to Figure 1: We know the stimuli on the left of the figure, and
we know your ratings on the right of the figure; we need now to
determine the psychological values in the middle of the figure.  For
example, we want to determine the psychological value for, say,
"level-headed," which can be added to the psychological value of
"good-natured," such that the sum matches your mean rating for the
pair, "level-headed" and "good-natured."  But these estimated
psychological values also have to simultaneously satisfy the other
ratings you gave.

<p>To get a feeling for how the model works, consider what the model
predicts for two different choices of psychological values, as shown
in Tables 3 and 4 (below). <em>For each table, add the indicated
psychological values of the characteristics and enter the sums in
cells of the tables. Then plot the predictions in the graph below each
table.</em> A few of the cells already have values in them, to help
you check your computations.

<p>In the graphs of the predictions, you should notice that the lines
are parallel. For example, the lines for "unsophisticated" and
"ungrateful" are the same distance apart for "good-natured," "bold"
and "humorless."  The additive model, by its additive nature, predicts
that the lines will be parallel.


<p> <em>What you must now do is choose psychological values that best
fit your ratings.</em> The idea behind the choice is simple enough: We
find the psychological values which, when added together, get as close
as possible to your mean ratings.  In general it will not be possible
to match your ratings exactly.  This is because there are only
<em>six</em> psychological values we can choose, but there are
<em>nine</em> ratings we want to predict.

<p> The best estimate of the values is derived very much like analysis
of variance (ANOVA) or linear regression.  The whole point of ANOVA is
to determine whether <em>additive</em> effects of the factors can
explain the results, and the model we are examining here is also
additive.  In ANOVA, the best estimates for the effects of the factors
are related to the means. We will do essentially the same thing here.

<p>We need to find (1) the mean ratings you gave to
individual characteristics, and (2) the overall mean rating you gave.
First, copy into Table 5 (below) the cell means from Table 2
(above).  Be careful to copy accurately. Now compute the "marginal"
means (i.e., means on the margin of the table), as follows.  For cells
in the table with the phrase <em>row mean</em> (far right column),
compute the mean rating for that row.  For example, the row mean for
<strong>level-headed</strong> is the mean of the three cell-means for
level-headed; thus, for the cells labelled a, b, and c, the row mean
is (a+b+c)/3.



<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td colspan=5 align=center><em>Table 5: Marginal and Overall Means</em></td>

<td align=center></td>
<td align=center><strong>good-natured</strong></td>

<td align=center><strong>humorless</strong></td>

<td align=center>
<strong>level-headed</strong>
</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(a)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(b)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(c)</td>
<td><em>row mean</em> (a+b+c)/3 = _____ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>
<strong>unsophisticated</strong>
</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(d)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(e)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(f)</td>
<td><em>row mean</em> (d+e+f)/3 = _____ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>
<strong>ungrateful</strong>
</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(g)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(h)</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;<br>(i)</td>
<td><em>row mean</em> (g+h+i)/3 = _____ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>column mean</em>  (a+d+g)/3   = _____ </td>
<td><em>column mean</em>  (b+e+h)/3   = _____ </td>
<td><em>column mean</em>  (c+f+i)/3   = _____ </td>
<td><em>Overall mean</em> (a+...+i)/9 = _____ </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now you convert the marginal means to <em>estimated psychological
values</em> by subtracting half of the overall mean from each marginal
mean.  For example, the psychological value for level-headed is its
row mean minus half of the overall mean.  Write these estimated
psychological values for each characteristic in Table 6 (below).
It is possible, but rare, to get negative values.

<p>Finally, to get the predicted ratings of the additive model, just
fill in the cells of Table 6 by adding the values of the row and
column characteristics.

</td>
<td valign=top>
Now plot the predicted ratings of the additive model in Graph 2, just
as you plotted your mean ratings above (in Graph 1).  Your predicted values
might go off the top or bottom of the graph; just draw as neatly as you can.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Does the model fit the data?</strong> We could answer this
question using inferential statistics (ANOVA), but here we will just
make qualitative comparisons of the data and the predictions.  We will
first consider whether the data show any <em>cross overs</em>,
contrary to the predictions (which must be parallel).  Then we will
consider another indicator of whether the data are parallel, namely,
the extent to which there are changes in the distance between lines.


<p>Do any of the lines in your graph of the predicted ratings (Graph 2)
<em>cross over each other</em>? (They shouldn't, of course.)
<br>
<center>Circle one: <em>Yes / No</em></center>

<p>Do any of the lines in your graph of your mean ratings (Graph 1)
<em>cross over each other</em>? (They might.)
<br>
<center>Circle one: <em>Yes / No</em></center>

<p>For each characteristic on the X-axis of your graph of predicted
ratings (Graph 2), compute the <em>range of ratings</em>. That is,
compute the difference between the highest mean rating and the lowest
mean rating, separately for each X-axis characteristic.  You will need
to consult the columns of Table 6 to get exact values.  Enter the
results in Table 7 (below). (Of course, because the predicted lines
should be parallel, the range should be the same for all X-axis
characteristics.)

<p><strong>Group Data.</strong> Average data from a large number of
participants are shown on <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/model_exercises/additive_integration/ai_results.html">linked
page</a>.

<p><strong>Laboratory results.</strong> In a laboratory version of
this experiment (see "To learn more," below), the mean ratings were
very well fit by the additive model.  Other kinds of information
integration are better fit by other integration functions.  For
example, consider playing poker against two other players.  Suppose
you are told the strength of the other players' hands - weak, medium,
or strong - and you must rate how tough it is to win against them.  In
this situation, peoples' ratings are best fit by a multiplicative
model.


<p><strong>So what?</strong> How people integrate information to make
decisions is a crucial issue in a wide range of situations.
Manufacturers want to know how consumers integrate information about
various products to decide what brand to buy.  Retailers want to know
how people combine information about stores to decide where to shop.
Managers want to know how employees combine information to make
critical decisions on the job.  Lawyers want to know how jurists
combine information to decide guilt or innocence.  You can think of
many other situations where an understanding of information
integration in decision making could have huge consequences.

<p><strong>To learn more:</strong> This exercise is based on an
article by N. H. Anderson (1962), "Application of an additive model to
impression formation," <em>Science</em>, v.138, pp.817-818.

topic.
