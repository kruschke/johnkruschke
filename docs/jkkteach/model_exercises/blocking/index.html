<center><h2>Blocking of Learning</h2></center>


<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> The are many situations in life when
we must rapidly learn a lot of new things.  Children learn that
squiggles shaped like "R" make the /r/ sound, and squiggles shaped
like "P" make the /p/ sound.  Adults learn that certain flavors of
wine are called "merlot," but other flavors are called "burgundy."
Physicians learn than certain combinations of symptoms indicate one
disease, but a different combination of symptoms indicates a different
disease.


<p><strong>Try it yourself.</strong> Suppose you are a new clinician
learning to classify case histories of patients into disease
categories.  You see a list of symptoms, make your best diagnosis, and
then the expert physician tells you the correct diagnosis.  Gradually
you learn what symptoms correspond to what diseases.  You'll be doing
a simple learning task like this.
