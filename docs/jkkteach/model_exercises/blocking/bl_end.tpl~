<p><strong>The Underlying Structure of the Symptoms and
Diseases.</strong> In the first part of the experiment, you were trained
on 18 cases of the following two associations:
<center>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td align=center><em>stiff neck</em> -> A</td>
<td align=center><em>dizziness</em> -> B</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In the next part of the experiment, you studied 18 cases these two
associations:

<center>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td align=center>
 <table>
 <tr>
  <td><em>stiff neck</em><br><em>pallid skin</em></td>
  <td>-></td>
  <td>A</td>
 </tr>
 </table>
</td>
<td align=center>
 <table>
  <tr>
  <td><em>itchy toes</em><br><em>double vision</em></td>
  <td>-></td>
  <td>B</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

Notice that in this second phase, the structure of the two diseases is
the same: Both diseases have two symptoms.  In particular, the number
of times you saw <em>pallid skin</em> paired with A was the same
number of times you saw <em>itchy toes</em> (or <em>double
vision</em>) paired with B. <em> Therefore, if all that matters about
learning is the number of times that a symptom is paired with a
disease, you should have learned the association from <em>pallid
skin</em> to A as well as you learned the association from <em>itchy
toes</em> (or <em>double vision</em>) to B.</em>

<p>This prediction was tested in the last part of the experiment.  One
of the symptom combinations you were tested with was <em>pallid
skin</em> and <em>itchy toes</em> (see the "blocking" column of Table
1). If you learned an association from <em>pallid skin</em> to disease
A just as strong as you learned an association from <em>itchy
toes</em> to disease B, then your responses to this case should show
no preference for disease A or disease B.  That is, your responses
should be sometimes positive (indicating disease A) and sometimes
negative (indicating disease B), averaging about zero.  The same 50-50
ambivalence should happen for cases of <em>pallid skin</em> with
<em>double vision</em>. <em>Most people, however, show a preference
for disease B in these cases. It is as if learning about the
association from <em>pallid skin</em> to disease A was "blocked,"
i.e., prevented, in the second phase of training.  This phenomenon is
called <strong>blocking</strong> of associative learning.</em>



<p>The test phase of the experiment also had cases of <em>stiff
neck</em> (which indicated disease A) combined with either <em>itchy
toes</em> or <em>double vision</em> (which indicated disease B). These
cases are included in the right column of Table 1.  If you learned
associations from <em>itchy toes</em> or <em>double vision</em> to
disease B as strong as the association from <em>stiff neck</em> to
disease A, then you should have shown only 50-50 ambivalence for these
cases.  That is, your average response should be about zero. <em>Many
people, however, show a preference for disease A in these cases.  It
is as if the two symptoms of disease B mutally
<strong>overshadowed</strong> each other during learning, so that each
symptom carries just part of the associative power.</em> (Note: This
experimental design is <em>not</em> appropriate for a true
demonstration of overshadowing, because <em>stiff neck</em> occurred
more frequently than <em>itchy toes</em> or <em>double
vision</em>. The gist is correct, however.)


<p><strong>Summarize your data.</strong>
In the last row of Table 1, compute and write in the means of the
columns in the space provided.

<p><strong>A Theory of Associative Learning.</strong>

Phenomena such as blocking of associative learning inspired theorists
who developed the idea that associations are changed only when the
outcome is unexpected or surprising (Kamin, 1968).  Instead of
strengthening an association between a cue and and outcome
<em>any</em> time they happened to co-occur, the association is
strengthened only when the outcome is <em>unexpected</em> in the
presence of the cue.

<p>This theory accounts for blocking in the following way.  In the
first phase of training, you learned that <em>stiff neck</em>
indicates disease A.  In the second phase of training, you were
trained with cases of <em>stiff neck</em> and <em>pallid skin</em>
resulting in disease A.  Because you already expected disease A from
the presence of <em>stiff neck</em>, there was little surprise when
disease A indeed occurred, and therefore there was little learning of
an association between <em>pallid skin</em> and disease A.  On the
other hand, both of the disease B symptoms, <em>itchy toes</em> and
<em>double vision</em>, were new in the second phase, and so disease B
was unanticipated, and therefore there was significant learning of
associations between both the symptoms, <em>itchy toes</em> and
<em>double vision</em>, and disease B.  Consequently, in the test
phase, when <em>pallid skin</em> is put in conflict with <em>itchy
toes</em> (or with <em>double vision</em>), the stronger association
from <em>itchy toes</em> (or <em>double vision</em>) dominates the
weaker association from <em>pallid skin</em>.


<p><strong>A Formal Model.</strong>

The theory described above can be expressed in a formal, i.e.,
mathematical, model (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972).  The model simply
takes the English expressions from the previous paragraph and
translates them into mathematical symbols.  The power of doing this is
that the mathematical formulation generates precise and definite
predictions that are only vague and uncertain in the verbal
expression.

<p>The foundation of the model is a simple connectionist network
(similar to the interactive activation model of letter recognition,
which you learned about in relation to the word-superiority effect).
Simple nodes represent symptoms or diseases, and weighted connections
represent learned associations.  Figure 1, below, shows an
illustration of the model.  Figures 2.1-2.4 show an extended example
of the computations.

<p>

<strong>Figure 1: A connectionist model of learned
associations.</strong>

When symptoms are presented, the corresponding symptom nodes are
activated at the bottom of the network.  Activation then flows across
the connections to the disease nodes.  The connections have different
strengths, or weights, so that activation flows across some
connections more than others.  The weight on the connection represents
the learned association between a symptom and a disease.  That is, the
weights are the long term memory.  The disease nodes are activated to
the extent that there is activation flowing into them from the
connections.  The model guesses the disease with the greater
activation.  Once the correct answer is supplied, the model adjusts
its connection weights so that its disease activations are closer to
the correct answer.  By learning the weights, the model reduces the
discrepancy between its guesses and the correct answer, so that there
is less surprise when the cases recur on subsequent trials.

<p>The equations on the right side of the figure provide the
mathematical expression of these simple ideas.

<ul>

<li>The activation of symptom s is denoted by a<sub>s</sub>, shown in
the bottom equation of the diagram.  For example, if <em>stiff
neck</em> is presented, then the "stiff neck" symptom node is
activated, such that a<sub>stiff_neck</sub>=1.

<li>The weight on the connection from symptom s to disease d is
denoted w<sub>ds</sub>. This weight represents the strength of the
association from symptom s to disease d.

<li>The activation of the disease d is denoted a<sub>d</sub>, and is
computed as the weighted sum of the symptom activations, as shown by
the next-to-top equation in Figure 1.

<li>The correct answer, or "teacher," is denoted by t<sub>d</sub>, as
shown by the top equation in Figure 1.  If disease A is the correct
answer, then t<sub>A</sub>=1 and t<sub>B</sub>=0.  If disease B is the
correct answer, then t<sub>A</sub>=0 and t<sub>B</sub>=1.

<li>Associations are learned by the weight-change rule shown in the
next-to-bottom equation in Figure 1.  The triangle in front of the w
is an upper case Greek letter delta, which stands for "change" or
"difference."  The equation indicates that the change in the weight is
proportional to the error between the teacher value and the predicted
value, t<sub>d</sub>-a<sub>d</sub>.  The "lrate" is just the learning
rate, which is a constant that determines how extremely the weights
respond to error; we will just set it at 0.5.  The equation for weight
change also includes the factor a<sub>s</sub>, which simply means that
the weight will change only if the symptom is actually present; you
don't learn about symptoms that aren't there (according to this
model).

</ul>

<p>A thorough example is now provided in Figures 2.1-2.4 so you can
see exactly how the model works.  <em>In these figures, "dizziness" is
not included because it turns out to have no influence on the model's
behavior after the first phase training.  Some of the connections are
also excluded because they never change from the initial weights of
zero.</em>

<strong>
Figure 2.1: Training trial 1 of example computations.
</strong>

On this first trial of training, <em>stiff neck</em> is presented, and
the correct answer is A.  This is indicated in the left part of the
figure.

<p>The middle part of the figure indicates how activation spreads from
the symptom nodes to the disease nodes.  <em>Numbers inside the nodes
indicate the activations of the nodes.  Numbers next to connections
indicate the weights on those connections.</em> Only the "stiff neck"
node is activated in the input, because it is the only symptom
present.  Because this is the first trial of training, nothing has yet
been learned, and so all the connections weights start at zero.
Because the weights are zero, no activation is spread to the disease
nodes, and so the disease activations are also zero.

<p>The right part of the figure indicates how the weights change to
reduce error.  For every connection, the learning rule is applied.  In
particular, for the connection from "stiff neck" to A, the change in
weight is lrate*(t<sub>A</sub>-a<sub>A</sub>)*a<sub>stiff_neck</sub> =
.5*(1-0)*1 = .5.  For the connection from "pallid skin" to A, the
change in weight is
lrate*(t<sub>A</sub>-a<sub>A</sub>)*a<sub>pallid_skin</sub> =
.5*(1-0)*0 = 0.  And so forth for the other connections.  <em>The
numbers next to the connections are the changes in the weights.</em>
These weight changes get added to the weights from the beginning of
the trial, before the next trial begins.

<strong>
Figure 2.2: Training trial 2 of example computations.
</strong>

On this trial, we happen to have two symptoms presented (see the left
part of the figure), hence both of those symptoms' input nodes are
activated (in the middle part of the figure).  <em>Notice that the
weight from "stiff neck" to A is 0+.5=.5 at the beginning of this
trial</em>.

<p>The activation of disease A is .5 because
w<sub>A,stiff_neck</sub>*a<sub>stiff_neck</sub> +
w<sub>A,pallid_skin</sub>*a<sub>pallid_skin</sub> +
w<sub>A,itchy_toes</sub>*a<sub>itchy_toes</sub> +
w<sub>A,double_vision</sub>*a<sub>double_vision</sub>
= .5*1 + 0*1 + 0*0 + 0*0 = .5.


<p>Examine the weight changes carefully: For the connection from
"stiff neck" to A, the change in weight is
lrate*(t<sub>A</sub>-a<sub>A</sub>)*a<sub>stiff_neck</sub> =
.5*(1-.5)*1 = .25.  For the connection from "pallid skin" to A, the
change in weight is
lrate*(t<sub>A</sub>-a<sub>A</sub>)*a<sub>pallid_skin</sub> =
.5*(1-.5)*1 = .25. These weight changes get added to the weights from
the beginning of the trial, before the next trial begins.

Figure 2.4: Testing trial of example computations.
</strong>

In this <em>testing</em> trial, no correct feedback is presented, and
so the teacher values are unknown and there is no learning.  But
notice that the activation of the two diseases is not the same,
despite the fact that one symptom of each disease is presented.  Here
the model is exhibiting blocking.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><strong>In summary,</strong> the <em>representation</em> in this
model is simplistic: node activations represent the presence or
absence of corresponding symptoms or diseases.  The content is just
presence or absence of symptoms, and the format is just an unordered
set, much like feature theory in pattern recognition.  The
<em>processes</em> in this model are twofold: For generating
predictions, there is spreading activation (i.e., activation that
starts at the input and spreads to the output). For learning, there is
surprisingness-driven weight changing.

<p>Don't lose the psychological forest for the mathematical trees.
The psychological idea is simply that you build up associations
between cues and an outcome to the extent that the outcome is
unexpected.  The mathematical model is just a way of making this idea
precise.  (The mathematics here are very simple, too.)  The building
of associations is the foundation of memory, and so this experiment
and the model is addressing fundamental principles of memory and
learning.  The phenomenon addressed here, i.e., blocking, is also an
example of the first theme of memory emphasized in class: Memory is
selective. We don't learn about every cue just because it is there.
We learn about it only if we need to, only if something unexpected
happens.



<p><strong>Generate predictions of the model.</strong>

Table 2 (below) lists the trials in a simplified version of the
learning sequence you went through.  Instead of 36 cases that you
experienced, only 6 are listed below.  For the first training phase,
there are 2 cases of <em>stiff neck</em> -> disease A.  No
cases of <em>dizziness</em> -> disease B are listed, because these
cases have no subsequent influence on the model's predictions.  For
the second training phase, there are 2 cases of <em>stiff neck</em>
and <em>pallid skin</em> -> disease A, and 2 cases of <em>itcy
toes</em> and <em>double vision</em> -> disease B.

<p>For each row of Table 2, fill in the values appropriately. Each row
corresponds to one trial of learning; i.e., one case of symptoms with
correct diagnosis.  Use a learning rate of lrate=0.5 to determine the
change in weights. The "current weights" of one trial are the weights
of the previous trial plus the change in weights of the previous
trial.
