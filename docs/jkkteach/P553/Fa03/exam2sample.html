P553 Statistics in Psychology, Prof. Kruschke<br>
</h3>
<h2>
Sample Exam 2
</h2>
</center>

<p>This exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged
to use a calculator.  There are 100 points possible, with points for
each problem as marked.  Distributed separately will be tables of
critical values and power. Please do not write on these tables because
they will be re-used for future exams.  You have 75 minutes; please
allocate your time carefully.

<p>Use blank pieces of paper to write your answers. Write your name on
the top of each page, and attach the pages to this exam. Clearly
indicate the number and sub-part of the problem you are
answering. Please annotate your work; an uncommented stream of
scribbles that mysteriously ends up with the right answer will not get
full credit!

<p>For all inferential tests, assume a two-tailed test with 5% Type I
error rate.

<p><strong><li>t-test of independent means (35 pts):</strong> 

<p>
<TABLE align="right" border="1">
<TR><TH>Group 1 (N<SUB>1</SUB>=4)</TH><TH>Group 2 (N<SUB>2</SUB>=3)</TH></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>1</TD><TD>6</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>3</TD><TD>9</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>5</TD><TD>12</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>7</TD><TD></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<strong>(a, 15 pts)</strong> Conduct a <EM>t</EM>-test on the scores
shown at the right. You may assume pooled variance. Can the null
hypothesis of equal means be rejected? What are the assumptions of
using the critical t values in the table?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><strong>(b, 5 pts)</strong> Compute the confidence interval for
the difference of means (using the approximation in the textbook and
used by SPSS).

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><strong>(c, 5 pts)</strong> What is the estimated effect size in
the population?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><strong>(d, 5 pts)</strong> Suppose, in some other data set, that
N<SUB>1</SUB>=22 and N<SUB>2</SUB>=19, and that the effect size was
estimated to be 0.53. What is the approximate power of the
<EM>t</EM>-test?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p><strong>(e, 5 pts)</strong> Suppose you use SPSS to run a
<EM>t</EM>-test of some other data set. The output indicates the
following for Levene's test of equality of variances: F=4.041,
Sig=0.021. The output also indicates that for equal variances assumed,
<EM>t</EM>=2.83 with Sig=0.036, and that for unequal variances
assumed, <EM>t</EM>=2.11 with Sig=0.171. Are the two groups means
significantly different or not (for 95% confidence)? <em>Why?</em>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<p><strong><li>One way ANOVA (20 pts):</strong> 

<p>
<TABLE align="right" border="1">
<TR><TH>Group 1 (N<SUB>1</SUB>=3)</TH><TH>Group 2 (N<SUB>2</SUB>=3)</TH><TH>Group 3 (N<SUB>3</SUB>=3)</TH></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>7</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>11</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>9</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>13</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>11</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>15</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<strong>(a, 12 pts)</strong> Conduct an omnibus ANOVA on the scores shown in
the table at the right. What are the assumptions of
using the critical F values in the table?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<strong>(b, 4 pts)</strong> What is the proportion of total variance
in the scores accounted for by the variance between group means?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><strong>(c, 4 pts)</strong> Suppose, in some other data set, that
N<SUB>1</SUB>=N<SUB>2</SUB>=N<SUB>3</SUB>=29, and that R^2 was
estimated to be 0.062. What is the approximate power of the omnibus
<EM>F</EM>-test?

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<p><strong><li>Bivariate correlation and regression (30 pts):</strong> 

<p>
<TABLE align="right" border="1">
<TR><TH>Subject</TH><TH>X</TH><TH>Y</TH></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>1</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>2</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>2</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>3</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>3</TD></TR>
<TR align="center"><TD>4</TD><TD>14</TD><TD>5</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<strong>(a, 10 pts)</strong> Compute the correlation of the scores
shown in the table at the right. Is it significantly greater than
zero?  What are the assumptions of using the critical values in the
table (be careful how you state these)?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p><strong>(b, 3 pts)</strong> What is the proportion of total
variance in Y accounted for by the linear predictions?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p><strong>(c, 3 pts)</strong> What is the estimated effect size in
the population?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p><strong>(d, 10 pts)</strong> What is the linear regression equation
in standardized scores? What is the linear regression equation in
non-standardized (raw) scores? For a value of X=16, what is the
predicted value of Y according to the linear regression equation?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p><strong>(e, 4 pts)</strong> Suppose, in some other data set, that
N=32 and that the correlation was estimated to be 0.26. What is the
approximate power of the test (relative to a null hypothesis that the
correlation is zero)?
