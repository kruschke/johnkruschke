<p>
In the SPSS book see Ch. 15-16, pp. 163+.
<ol>


<p><li>(4 pts.)  Enter the raw data (X and Y values) from Table 3-3,
p.86, into SPSS. Run SPSS "Analyze/ Correlate/ Bivariate" on the
data. Does the correlation value in SPSS match the value shown in
Table 3-3? Now let's use SPSS to compute the correlation via the
standardized scores, as in Table 3-3. To determine the standardized
scores in SPSS, use "Analyze/ Descriptive_Statistics/ Descriptives..."
and check the box in the lower-left corner than says "Save
standardized values as variables." After running the descriptives
procedure, check the data spreadsheet, and you'll find the
standardized values of the scores. Are they the same values as in
Table 3-3? <em>Why not?</em> Multiply the standardized scores that
SPSS computed by sqrt(N/(N-1)). To do this, use "Transform/
Compute..." Now do the transformed standardized values match those in
Table 3-3? Why?

<p><li>(5 pts.)  Use the linked <a href="sampler.sps">SPSS syntax
file</a> to explore sampling distributions of <em>r</em>, the Pearson
correlation.  Please run the file in SPSS and do the following.

<ul>

<li>For both of the scatterplots, pull the label of the regression
line away from the scatterplot by doing the following: Double click
the scatterplot so that the chart editing tool bars appear around the
scatterplot. The third button across the top is the Chart
Manager. Click it. Under "Elements" click "Regression", then "Edit",
and then "Options". On the "Appearance" tab, go to the "Location" box
and select "Right". Then click "Apply" and "OK".

<li>Next to each scatterplot, write a very brief title that states
what the scatterplot represents (and I don't just mean "Y1 plotted
against X1"). In the scatterplots, does the slope of the regression
line closely approximate the correlation of the population from which
the scores were drawn? Annotate your SPSS output with your answer.

<li>In the graphs of the sampling distributions, fill in the blanks in
the title with appropriate numbers.

<li>From the Frequencies output of the null hypothesis sampling
distribution, highlight the critical values for a two-tailed Type-I error
rate of 5%. Now convert this to a t-score. Does it match the
corresponding critical t value tabled in the back of the textbook? Be
sure to state what the corresponding critical t value is, with its df.
Mark the critical values in the two sampling distributions.

<li>From the Frequencies output for the alternative hypothesis
sampling distribution, determine the approximate power (within
5%). Does this match the power listed in Table 3-11, p. 111? (Report
what the power is in Table 3-11.)

</ul>

<p> <li>(4 pts.) For the data in #11, p. 105, do the following <strong>by
hand and show your work</strong>:

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation by hand, using the defining formula.

<li>Test the null hypothesis (convert <em>r</em> to <em>t</em>).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X).

<li>Determine the linear regression equation.

<li> Verify your results so far in SPSS. (Include the print out and
brief annotation indicating the match with your by-hand results.)

<li>What is the predicted anxiety scores for a person with a dexterity
score of zero?  And for a person with a dexterity score of 3?

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
<li>(4 pts.) For the data in #12, p. 106, do
the same thing as the previous exercise.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(4 pts.) For the data in #14, p. 107, do the following <strong>in
SPSS</strong>. (The second data column should be headed "Y" instead of
"X.")

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation. Highlight/mark the print-out where this
is shown.

<li>Test the null hypothesis (two-tailed). Highlight/mark the
print-out where this is shown.

<li>Determine the approximate power (use Table 3-11, p. 111).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X). Highlight/mark the print-out where this is shown or
from where you took values to compute it.

<li>Determine the linear regression equation. Highlight/mark the
print-out where this is shown.

<li>What is the predicted value of number of people stopping to look
for a painting that is just done (zero years old)?  And for a painting
that is 1,000 years old?

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(2 pts.) P. 154,  #22.  Instead of "explaining these results to
someone who has never had exposure to regression," briefly explain the
importance of each beta value under "Retribution" in Table 4-11.  Also
explain the meaning of the R<sup>2</sup> value in the "Retribution"
column.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(2 pts.) P. 156,  #23.
