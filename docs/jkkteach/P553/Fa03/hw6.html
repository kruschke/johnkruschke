Homework 6. Due Tuesday 21 October 2003.

</center>

<p>
In the SPSS book see Ch. 13, p. 135.  <strong>In all SPSS analyses of
variance, please include Descriptive Statistics and the test of
Homogeneity of Variance (check the boxes within the Options menu; see
pp. 139 etc. of the SPSS book). Also make a bar graph of the group
means with error bars that indicate 1 SE (use Graphs/ Interactive/
Bar/ and then the Error Bars tab).</strong>

<ol>

<p><li>(4 pts) F distribution: Use the linked <a
href="samplef.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore sampling
distributions of <em>F</em>.  The file generates 5 different sampling
distributions of F. For each of the five distributions, there is (a) a
table of "Descriptive Statistics", (b) a table of "Statistics" that
shows critical percentiles for F, and (c) a histogram.  Please run the
file in SPSS and do the following.

<ul>

<li>The output includes 5 histograms of F sampling distributions. The
graphs have titles and subtitles with some missing numbers, indicated
by underlines like this: ___. Write in the appropriate values in all
the blanks. In particular, the blanks in F(__,__) refer to the
<em>df</em> for the numerator and denominator of F. For each graph
that was generated by populations with all means=0, write next to it
the words "Null Hypothesis". For each other graph, write next to it
the words "Alternative Hypothesis"

<li>The output includes 5 tables of "Statistics" that specify the
percentiles in the F distributions. <em>If the population corresponds
to a null hypothesis</em>, then write the corresponding critical
values from the F tables (in the textbook appendix) next to the SPSS
output values. (The SPSS output values should be close to the tabled
critical values.)

<li>The output includes 5 tables of "Statistics" that specify the
percentiles in the F distributions. <em>For the two populations that
are NOT null hypotheses</em>, determine the power of the experiments
(to within the nearest 5%) assuming a Type I error rate of
.05. Describe in writing next to the table of percentiles how you
arrived at your answer. For the case with a sample size of 10, assume
that the alternative hypothesis corresponds to a "large" effect size,
and report the corresponding power listed in Table 12-7, p. 435 of the
textbook.

<li>The output includes 5 tables of "Descriptive Statistics" that show
the means of MSB, MSW, F, and RSQ. The (mean of) MSW is the (average)
unbiased estimate of the population SD obtained by pooling the
samples. Next to each table, write the <em>expected value of MSW, like
this: E(MSW)=____</em> (and fill in the blank with the appropriate
value). When the null hypothesis is true, the MSB is also an unbiased
estimate of the population SD. Next to each table <em>for a null
hypothesis</em>, write the <em>expected value of MSB, like this:
E(MSB)=____</em> (and fill in the blank with the appropriate value).

<li>For your personal edification, <strong>look</strong> at the
various F distributions you have generated. Notice how they change
depending of df_B and df_W. <em>Visualize diagrams of the
corresponding populations that generated the distributions.</em>

</ul>


<p><li>(3 pts.)

Suppose an experiment has three conditions with three subjects each,
with scores as follows:

<center>
<table width=100%>
<tr>
<td align=right>Group A: 1, 2, 3</td>
<td align=center>Group B: 2, 3, 4</td>
<td align=left>Group C: 5, 6, 7</td>
</tr></table>
</center>

Conduct an omnibus ANOVA completely by hand, showing your work.  Then
verify your computations with SPSS, including your printout. (See note
at top of assignment regarding what to include in your SPSS output!)

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 413, #14.  Do with SPSS. Also: (i) What is the proportion of
variance accounted for by group membership?  Also: (ii) Notice that
all that differs between part (a) and part (b) is the mean of Group 2,
but the <em>range</em> of group means is the same.  What component(s)
of the F statistic is affected by this change in group mean?


<p><li>(3 pts.)

P.412, #12.  Write down the three lists of words that you find, and
indicate the length of each word.  You can conduct the analysis in
SPSS if you like. (If your dictionary does not have as many pages as
in the list of random numbers, do the following: For each of the first
10 page numbers in the list that is within the range of your
dictionary pages, find the first noun, first verb, and first
adjective. Or, use some online dictionary and grab words in some
reasonable way that you explain.)


<p><li>(3 pts.)
P. 413, #16.  Show your work, but do not do parts (a), (b) or (c).


<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 447, #14. Don't do parts (a) or (b).  Do by hand; verify in SPSS.
Also: Compute R<sup>2</sup>.  Annotate how you determine R<sup>2</sup>
from your SPSS print out.

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 448,  #21 AND #22.
