P553 Statistics in Psychology, Prof. Kruschke<br>
</h3>
<h2>
Exam 3 (Final) Sample Questions
</h2>
</center>

<p>The exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged to
use a calculator.  There are 100 points possible, with points for each
problem as marked.  You have 120 minutes; please allocate your time
carefully.

<p><strong>1. (35 pts total)</strong> <br>Suppose the annual salary of
people who have completed at least one statistics course is compared
with the annual salary of people who have never completed a
statistics course.  Here are the results from a random sample:  
<center>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td align=right>With stat's course:</td> 
<td>$25,790. $33,115. $42,521. $54,598.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=right>Without stat's course:</td>
<td>$36,598. $46,993. $60,340. $77,478.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p><strong>1A (15 pts).</strong> Of the following data
transformations, which is the best to use in this case?  ln(x),
x<sup>2</sup>, exp(x), x<sup>3</sup>, sin<sup>-1</sup>(x).  Apply the
best transformation and conduct a <em>t</em>-test of independent
means.  Assume a two-tailed test with Type I error rate of 5%.  What
are the assumptions of the test?  Have they been satisfied?

<p><strong>1B (15 pts).</strong> Transform the raw scores to rank
scores, and conduct a t-test on the rank scores.  Assume a two-tailed
test with Type I error rate of 5%.  Does your conclusion agree with
your conclusion from the previous Part?

<p><strong>1C (5 pts).</strong> Suppose we make no population
assumptions at all, and treat the eight scores in the data as
representative of the entire population, and conduct a randomization
test.  How many combinations of scores would we have to consider to
generate the full sampling distribution?  That is, what is the maximum
number of discrete ``spikes'' in the sampling distribution of
differences of means? (Determine the exact number explicitly, don't
leave it as merely a factorial.)

<p><strong>2. (35 pts total)</strong> To solve these you'll need to
consult a table of binomial probabilities.  See the web page for a
links to binomial tables.

<p><strong>2A (10 pts).</strong> Suppose we flip a coin seven times and
it comes up heads six times.  Can we reject the null hypothesis that
the coin is fair?  Assume a two-tailed test with Type I error rate at
most 5%.

<p><strong>2B (15 pts).</strong> Suppose we have an alternative
hypothesis that the coin is biased, with probability of heads p=.75.
If we now assume a directional test, with Type I error rate at most
5% (or less), what is the power of the test?  (Again, with N=7 and
null hypothesis p=.5.)

<p><strong>2C (10 pts).</strong> Suppose we flip the coin 700 times
and it comes up heads 400 times.  Can we reject the null hypothesis
that the coin is fair?  Assume a two-tailed test with Type I error
rate at most 5%.

<p><strong>Or maybe the exam will have it this way:</strong> Do all
those using &chi;<sup>2</sup>. (Your results should match what you got
when using the binomial, unless N is too small for the &chi;<sup>2</sup>
approximation.)

<p><strong>3. (30 pts total)</strong> 

<p><strong>3A (15 pts).</strong> Suppose we toss a six-sided die 65
times, and observe the following frequency distribution:

<pre>
          outcome    1   2   3   4   5   6
          frequency 12  10  15   7  18   3
</pre>

Can the null hypothesis that the die is fair be rejected?  Assume a
Type I error rate of 5%.  (Be sure to show clearly the df you are
using.)  Has the test violated the conventional rules for a good
approximation by the continuous &chi;<sup>2</sup>?


<p><strong>3B (15 pts).</strong> Suppose we have a 3-sector spinner
and a coin.  We want to know whether the flip of the coin and the spin
of the spinner are independent.  Here are results from 54 pairs of
coin flips and spinner spins:

<pre>
                     Spinner
                    A   B   C
          Coin  H  13  16  10
                T   5   8   2
</pre>

Can the null hypothesis of independence be rejected?  Assume a Type I
error rate of 5%.  (Be sure to show clearly the df you are using.
Conduct the complete test even if the conventional guidelines for
approximating the continuous &chi;<sup>2</sup> are violated.  Are they
violated?)
