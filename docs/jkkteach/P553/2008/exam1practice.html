<p>Practice Exam 1
</h2>
<p>(Final update at 5:00 pm, Monday 9/28/98.)
</center>



<p> The exam will not be this long, but it will have problems like
these.  <em>You are encouraged to discuss these questions, and even
post answers or candidate answers, on the <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/p553_bbs/p553.cgi">Discussion
web page</a>.</em> Do not turn in answers to these problems.  This is
not a homework assignment.  There is no homework assignment this week,
other than doing these problems for your own review.

<p><li>Suppose you play "cut your losses" with a regular six-sided
die.  Losses are measured as the squared deviation between the guess
and the actual outcome.  Suppose Jack always guesses 5, and Jill
always guesses 3.  They role the die four times.  Will Jack be the
loser?

<p><li>Two neighborhoods are polled regarding opinions about a
proposed property tax increase.  In neighborhood A, 37% are in favor
of the increase.  In neighborhood B, 32% are in favor. Consider the
following proposed explanations for this difference:
<br>I. Neighborhood B has more expensive houses in a higher tax
bracket.  <br>II. Neighborhood B has more expensive properties, and
neighborhood A was more recently canvassed with pro-tax leaflets.
<br>III. The differences occurred only by chance sampling; the
neighborhoods really have the same proportion of residents in favor.
<br>Rank the explanations in terms of parsimony, from most
parsimonious to least, and explain why.

<p><li>(A.) Consider this set of five scores: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7.  What is the
mean?  What is the standard deviation (using <em>n-1</em> in the
denominator)?  What is the standardized score of Y=1?  Of Y=7?

<br><br>(B.) Suppose that the scores above were radii (radiuses) of
circles.  Convert the scores to the circles' areas (A = pi x
r<sup>2</sup>). What is the mean area? The standard deviation?  What
is the standardized score of Y = pi x 1<sup>2</sup>?  Of Y = pi x
7<sup>2</sup>?

<br><br>Is the mean of the circles' areas the same as the area of a
circle with the mean radius?

<br><br>(C.) Convert the scores to the circles' circumference (C =
pi x 2 x r). What is the mean circumference? The standard deviation?
What is the standardized score of Y = pi x 2 x 1?  Of Y = pi x 2 x 7?

<br><br>Is the mean of the circles' circumferencess the same as the
circumference of a circle with the mean radius?


<p><li>Construct a stem plot for the following data: <br> 24, 25, 34,
13, 36, 42, 40, 39, 38, 43, 27, 10, 12, 28, 30, 35, 24, 34, 15, 29,
31, 36, 30, 46, 28.
<br>Use a class interval width of 5 (e.g.,10-14, 15-19, etc.).

<p><li>Create back-to-back stem plots using the data from the previous
problem for one group, and the following data for the other group:
<br>20, 11, 18, 27, 20, 35, 33, 15, 28, 16, 22, 5, 17, 22, 33, 18, 28,
19, 12, 22, 13, 14, 22, 4, 23.

<p><li>Suppose each of two conditions has three observations:
<center>Group I: 1, 2, 3
<br>Group II: 3, 4, 5

<p><li>On a given day, a small hospital has ten births, with 7 boys
and 3 girls.  That same day, a larger hospital has one hundred births,
with 70 boys and 30 girls.  Which outcome is more probable?

<p><li>What's the probability of getting a "head" for the flip of a fair
coin?  What's the probability of getting a "1" for the roll of a fair
die?  What's the probability of getting a "head" for the flip of a
coin <em>and</em> getting a "1" for the roll of a die?

<p><li>Suppose you have 10 friends that need a ride, but you can only take
3 of them in your car.  How many different sets of friends might you
take?


<p><center><em>For the following problems, involving the binomial
distribution, you should be able to solve them without referring to a
table of binomial probabilities.  That is, you are expected to
memorize the binomial probability formula and know how to use it:
<br>P(r) = (N choose r) p<sup>r</sup> q<sup>N-r</sup>.</em></center>

<p><li>Suppose we flip a fair coin 3 times.  What is the probability
of getting zero heads?  1 head? 2 heads? 3 heads?

<p><li>In a five-alternative multiple choice exam, the probability of
answering correctly by chance is .2.  If there are 10 questions, what
is the probability that a student would get 8 or more correct purely
by chance?

<p><li>Consider two fair six-sided dice.  When we roll them, any
"doubles" (1&1, 2&2, 3&3, etc.) is considered a success.  What is the
probability of getting exactly 1 success out of 6 rolls?  Suppose we
roll the dice 360 times.  What is the expected number of successes?
What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (for 360
rolls)?  Approximately what percentage of the time would you expect to
get 67 or fewer successes out of 360 rolls?  (For this last question,
use the normal approximation to the binomial.  See Figure 4.25, p.200
of the textbook.)

<p><li>Informally state the central limit theorem for sample means.

<p><li>Why is the normal distribution a natural candidate for modeling
error residuals?  (Think carefully of a concise but complete answer.)

<p><li>For a sample of scores, what is value M that minimizes the
number of deviations from M?
<p><li>For a sample of scores, what is the value M that
minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations from M?
<p><li>For a sample of scores, what is the value M that makes
the data most probable for the model y<sub>i</sub>=M+e<sub>i</sub>,
where e<sub>i</sub>~X(0,sigma), the exponential distribution?
<p><li>For a sample of scores, what is the value M that
minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from M?
<p><li>For a sample of scores, what is the value M that makes
the data most probable for the model y<sub>i</sub>=M+e<sub>i</sub>,
where e<sub>i</sub>~N(0,sigma), the normal distribution?

<p><li>Suppose we have a the following random sample of scores:
<center>1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4.</center> Suppose we model the scores as a
central tendency with normally distributed residuals.  Which value for
central tendency makes the sample most probable?  Which value for the
variance makes the sample most probable?

<p><li>Suppose we have a the following random sample of scores:
<center>1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4.</center> Suppose we model the scores as a
central tendency with <strong>uniformly</strong> distributed
residuals. (An example of a uniform distribution is given in Fig.4.8,
p.181 of the textbook.) If the uniform distribution ranges from 2 to 3
(with P(x)=.5 for x=2 and x=3), what is the probability of getting the
sample?  Which range for the uniform distribution, 1-4 or 0-5,
makes the sample more probable?
