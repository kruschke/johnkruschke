If you can print two pages per side of paper, <i>and still have
clearly legible output</i>, please do so, in order to save paper.

<!--
<p><li>(4 pts.)  Enter the raw data (X and Y values) from Table 11-4,
p.460, into SPSS. Run SPSS "Analyze/ Correlate/ Bivariate" on the
data. Does the correlation value in SPSS match the value shown in
the Table? (It should.)

<br>Now let's use SPSS to compute the correlation via the
standardized scores. To determine the standardized
scores in SPSS, use "Analyze/ Descriptive_Statistics/ Descriptives..."
and check the box in the lower-left corner than says "Save
standardized values as variables." After running the descriptives
procedure, check the data spreadsheet, and you'll find the
standardized values of the scores. Are they the same values as in
the Table? <em>Why not?</em> 

<br>Multiply the standardized scores that
SPSS computed by sqrt(N/(N-1)). To do this, use "Transform/
Compute..." Now do the transformed standardized values match those in
Table 3-3? Why?
-->

<p><li>(5 pts.)  Use the linked <a href="SampleR.sps">SPSS syntax
file</a> to explore sampling distributions of <em>r</em>, the Pearson
correlation.  Please run the file in SPSS and do the following.

<ul>

<li>Next to each scatterplot, write a very brief title that states
what the scatterplot represents (and I don't just mean "Y1 plotted
against X1"). 

<li>After the scatterplots, a regression analysis shows the raw
regression coefficent for the points in the plot. Does the slope of
the regression line closely approximate the correlation of the
population from which the scores were drawn? Annotate your SPSS output
with your answer. (The answer is "yes", but don't just say "yes". Do
connect the coefficient in the regression analysis with the line in
the scatterplot and the specification of population correlation in the
syntax, and briefly describe their relation.)

<li>In the graphs of the sampling distributions, fill in the blanks in
the title with appropriate numbers.

<li>From the Frequencies output of the null hypothesis sampling
distribution, highlight the critical values for a two-tailed Type-I error
rate of 5%. Now convert this to a t-score. Does it match the
corresponding critical t value tabled in the back of the textbook? Be
sure to state what the corresponding critical t value is, with its df.
Mark the critical values in the two sampling distributions.

<li>From the Frequencies output for the alternative hypothesis
sampling distribution, determine the approximate power (within
5%). Does this match the power listed in Table 11-6, p. 475? (Report
what the power is in the Table.)

</ul>

<p> <li>(5 pts.) For the data in #12, p. 489, do the following <strong>by
hand and show your work</strong>:

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation by hand, <em>using the defining formula: r
is the average product of Z scores</em>, not the short-cut
computational formula. 

<li>Test the null hypothesis (convert <em>r</em> to <em>t</em>).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X).

<li>Determine the linear regression equation.

<li>Verify your results so far in SPSS. (Include the print out and
brief annotation indicating the match with your by-hand results.)

<li>What is the predicted anxiety score for a person with a dexterity
score of zero?  And for a person with a dexterity score of 3?

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
<li>(5 pts.) For the data in #13, p. 489: <em>Treat Aggressive Acts as
the X variable and treat TV Viewing as the Y variable.</em>

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation by hand, <em>using the defining formula: r
is the average product of Z scores</em>, not the short-cut
computational formula. 

<li>Test the null hypothesis (convert <em>r</em> to <em>t</em>).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X).

<li>Determine the linear regression equation.

<li>Verify your results so far in SPSS. (Include the print out and
brief annotation indicating the match with your by-hand results.)

<li>What is the predicted TV viewing time for a person who made no
violent acts?  And for a person who made 10 violent acts?

</ul>

(Yes, it's just more practice with the same thing as the previous
problem, but hey, it's the only practice you get with this stuff!)

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(5 pts.) For the data in #15, p. 490, do the following <strong>in
SPSS</strong>.


<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation. Highlight/mark the print-out where this
is shown.

<li>Test the null hypothesis (two-tailed). Highlight/mark the
print-out where this is shown.

<li>Determine the approximate power (use Table 11-6, p. 475).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X). Highlight/mark the print-out where this is shown or
from where you took values to compute it.

<li>Determine the linear regression equation. Highlight/mark the
print-out where this is shown.

<li>What is the predicted value of number of people stopping to look
for a painting that has just been finished (zero years old)?  And for
a painting that is 1,000 years old? (This gets you thinking about the
appropriateness of a linear prediction model.)

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(5 pts.) P. 540, Table 12-13. Briefly explain the meaning of
each beta value under "Retribution" for Control, Responsibility and
Anger; that is, explain what the beta value says about the
relationship between the predictor and the punishment goal.  Also
explain the meaning of the R<sup>2</sup> value in the "Retribution"
column.
