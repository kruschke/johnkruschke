<ol>

<p><li> (1 pt.) 

<br>(A) Look up and write down the critical F values, for p=.05, for 1
numerator df and 10, 20 and 30 denominator df. Label them as F
values. 

<br>(B) Take the square root of each and write down the result next to
it. Label them as sqrt(F).


<br>(C) Look up and write down the critical t values, for p=.05, for
10, 20 and 30 df. Label them as t. What do you notice about the
critical t values as compared with the F values?



<p>

<table align="right" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td> Group </td><td> Score </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> 4 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> 5 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> 6 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> 5 </td></tr>

<li> (16 pts) Consider the data in the table at the right.

<br>(A) Do a t-test by hand; show your work clearly. (Two-tailed, .05
false alarm rate)

<br>(B) Do an ANOVA by hand; show your work clearly. (.05 false alarm
rate)

<br>(C) Show that t<sup>2</sup>=F. 

<br>(D) What is SS<sub>pooled</sub> for the t-test? What is
MS<sub>within</sub> for the ANOVA? What is their relation?

<br>(E) Compute the correlation of Group and Score by hand; show your
work clearly.

<br>(F) Convert the correlation to a t value; is the correlation
significant? Does the t value match the value you computed in part
(A)?

<br>(G) Compute and write down r<sup>2</sup>. From the ANOVA in part
(B) compute and write down the proportion of variance accounted
for. What is the relation between them?

<br>(H) Write the equation for the best fitting regression line, for
predicting Score from Group. Show how you determined the slope and
intercept for the line. Using that equation for the line, determine the
predicted score when Group=1 and the predicted score when Group=2. How
do those predicted scores compare with the means of the groups that
you computed for the t-test in part (A)?


<p><li> (8 pts)

Using the data from the previous exercise:

<br>(A) In SPSS, do a t-test.

<br>(B) In SPSS, do a Oneway ANOVA.

<br>(C) In SPSS, compute the bivariate correlation.

<br>(D) In SPSS, make a scatterplot with the regression line and its
equation.
