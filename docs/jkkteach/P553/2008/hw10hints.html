<blockquote>
<strong>3. (4 pts total)</strong> Consider a null hypothesis of
p=.5 and an alternative hypothesis of p=.7.
<p><strong>3A. (2 pts)</strong> For N=6, what is the power of the
test?
</blockquote>

From the binomial table, we see that r<sub>crit</sub> is 6, because
going down to r=5 has greater than 5% probability in the tail of the
distribution...

<blockquote>
<p><strong>3B. (2 pts)</strong> If we want a power of at least .8,
what is the minimal N?
</blockquote>

<p>We can use the normal approximation to at least get an initial
value of N around which to search.

<p>From the non-directional null hypothesis, with a Type-I error rate
of .05, the normal approximation to the binomial implies that

<p><center>
z<sub>.05</sub>(r<sub>crit</sub>) = ( r<sub>crit</sub> - Np<sub>null</sub> ) 
/ sqrt(Np<sub>null</sub>q<sub>null</sub>)
<p>
1.96 =  ( r<sub>crit</sub> - N*.5 ) / sqrt(N*.5*.5)
</center>


<p>(I have not applied the correction for continuity in the above
formula, because we're only looking for an approximate N at this
point.)

<p>From the alternative hypothesis, for a power of .80, the normal
approximation to the binomial implies that

<p>
<center>
z<sub>.80</sub>(r<sub>crit</sub>) = ( r<sub>crit</sub> - Np<sub>alt</sub> ) 
/ sqrt(Np<sub>alt</sub>q<sub>alt</sub>)
<p>
-0.84 =  ( r<sub>crit</sub> - N*.7 ) / sqrt(N*.7*.3)
</center>

<p>(Again, I have not applied the correction for continuity in the
above formula, because we're only looking for an approximate N at this
point.)

<p>Now we just solve the two equations for N.  Then examine the exact
binomial probability tables around that value of N. 

<strong>Be sure to look at <a href="binom_in_spss.html">the web page
describing how to get binomial probabilities in SPSS.</a></strong>
Extra special bonus hint: r<sub>crit</sub> turns out to be 32.

<p><blockquote><strong>4.</strong> This is simply asking, what's the probability of
running an experiment twenty times and getting a false alarm twice, if the
null hypothesis is true?  
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<strong>4A. (2 pts)</strong> A random sample of 100 students has 54
females and 46 males.  Can the null hypothesis, that the student
population has 50% females, be rejected?
</blockquote>

<p>Assume a Type-I error rate of .05, two-tailed.
<br>Assume that "female" is "success."
<br>Use the normal approximation to the binomial.    
<br>Use the correction for continuity.

<p>Thus:  According to the null hypothesis,  mu = N*p = 100*.5 = 50.
<br>sigma = sqrt(N*p*q) =sqrt(100*.5*.5) = 5.

<p>WithOUT the correction for continuity, we have

<p><center>
z(54) = ( 54 - mu ) / sigma
</center>

<p>WITH the correction for continuity, we have

<p><center>
z(54) = ( (54-.5) - mu ) / sigma
</center>

<p>Does use of the correction for continuity affect the conclusion in
this case? (Answer: No.) What if we had r=60 instead of r=54; would
the correction for continuity affect the conclusion in this case?
(Answer: Yes.)
