<p>Exercises for Week 12
</h2>
</center>

<p>Wherever an exercise says to "conduct a test," it means that you
should also indicate the conclusion of the test; i.e., can the null
hypothesis be rejected?  All the exercises except the last part of the
last problem (i.e., the randomization test) should be done in SPSS.

<ol>

<p><li>(Equivalence of tests.) A zoologist is studying the sounds
produced by two species of bats.  She randomly samples 10 recordings
from each of the two species, and measures the dominant frequency (in
Hz) of each sound production.  The data are as follows:

<pre>
spec_1  spec_2
  4675   38177
 34544   80822
  6634    7708
   518    1212
  6974   46630
 13360    4024
   545   89322
   365     898
   314   32860
  1556    4230
</pre>

<ul>

<li>Make boxplots of the data from the two groups.

<li>Conduct a (two-tailed) t-test.  Is pooling of variances justified?
Are the distributions approximately normal?

<li>Conduct a Oneway ANOVA on the two groups.  From the previous
t-test, square the t values obtained for equal (pooled) and unequal
(not pooled) variances.  Which t<sup>2</sup> (pooled or not pooled)
equals F in the ANOVA?  Are the assumptions of the ANOVA satisfied?

<li>Compute the correlation between dominant frequency and species
membership.  Is it significantly different from zero?  Show that
r<sup>2</sup> equals SS<sub>B</sub>/SS<sub>T</sub>, from the previous
ANOVA.

<li>Conduct a linear regression analysis.  Species is the predictor
variable; dominant frequency is the predicted variable.  Using the
equation for the best fitting line, compute the means of the two
groups (show your work; i.e., show how you compute the group means
from the regression equation).

</ul>


<p><li>(Transforming to normality and homogeneity.) The zoologist of
the previous exercies is actually interested in the effective
<em>pitch</em> of the sound, not the raw frequency of the sound.  (To
convert to pitch from frequency, just take the logarithm of
frequency.) 

<ul>

<li>Make boxplots of the transformed data (pitch).

<li>Do the two species differ in the mean dominant pitch of their
sound productions? (Conduct a two-tailed t-test, pooling only if it
seems appropriate.)  Have the assumptions of the test been satisfied?

<li>Which t-test is more appropriate, the one conducted on frequency,
or the one conducted on pitch?

</ul>

<p><li>(Rank transformation -- Almost a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.)
Consider hypothetical data for two groups as follows:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Group 1: 1 20 22 24
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Group 2: 23 25 27 46

<ul>

<li>Conduct a two-tailed t-test on the scores (pooling if
appropriate). Are the assumptions of the t-test met?

<li>Convert the original scores to rank values.  Print the original
data and their corresponding ranks.

<li>Conduct a t-test on the ranks.  How does the conclusion compare
with the t-test on the raw data?

</ul>

<p><li>(Randomization test.) Consider two groups of three scores:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Group A: 4, 0, 1.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Group B: 9, 3, 8.

<ul>

<li>Conduct a t-test on the two groups.

<li>Convert the scores to ranks, and conduct a t-test on the ranks.

<li>Conduct a randomization test of the null hypothesis that the
groups are not different, using a (two-tailed) Type I error rate of
.10 (yes, .10).  For convencience, the twenty possible groupings of
the six scores are included <a href="wk12exer4.html">on another
page</a>.  List the twenty differences of means in order, and indicate
the high and low critical values for rejecting the null hypothesis.
Can the null hypothesis be rejected?

</ul>
