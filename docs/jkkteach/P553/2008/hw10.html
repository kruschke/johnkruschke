<h2>
P553 Statistics in Psychology
<br>Homework 10: The Binomial Distribution
<br>Due Tuesday 2 December 2008.
</h2>
</center>

These exercises assume a dichotomous, nominally-scaled population,
with the probability of success denoted "p" and the sample size
denoted "N," unless otherwise stated.

<p>See linked info about <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P553/binom_in_spss.html">how to
generate binomial and Poisson distributions in SPSS</a>, and some
<a href="hw10hints.html">hints</a>.

<p><strong>1. (5 pts)</strong> Derive (by hand, showing your
computations!) and graph three binomial distributions for p=.6: One
for N=1, a second for N=2, and a third for N=5.  Calculate the mean
and SD of each of each distribution, and mark them on the graphs.

<p><strong>2. (5 pts total)</strong> Consider a multiple-choice test with 20
questions, each of which has 5 possible answers.

<br><strong>2A. (2 pts)</strong> Suppose a student gets 7 correct.  Can
the hypothesis that the student was randomly guessing be rejected?
Use a two-tailed test.

<br><strong>2B. (3 pts)</strong> Suppose a student gets just 1 correct.
Can the hypothesis of random guessing be rejected?
Use a two-tailed test.


<p><strong>3. (5 pts total)</strong> Consider a null hypothesis of
p=.5 and an alternative hypothesis of p=.7.

<br><strong>3A. (2 pts)</strong> For N=6, what is the power of the
test?

<br><strong>3B. (3 pts)</strong> If we want a power of at least .8,
what is the minimal N?

<!--
<p><strong>4. (4 pts)</strong> Suppose we have a normal population
with mean 0.0 and SD 1.0, from which we draw random, independent
samples of size 25.  Set the false alarm (type I error) rate at 5%.
If we draw 20 samples, what is the probability of getting two or more
false alarms, i.e., two or more samples with a mean that exceeds the
critical value?  (Hint: For this problem, think of "the population" as
the dichotomized sampling distribution of the mean; less than critical
value [failure] versus greater than critical value [success]. See the
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P553/hw10no4.gif"
target="new">linked diagram</a> and the hints linked at the top of
this page.)

<p><strong>4. (5 pts total)</strong> 

<br><strong>4A. (2 pts)</strong> A random sample of 100 students has 54
females and 46 males.  Can the null hypothesis, that the student
population has 50% females, be rejected?

<br><strong>4B. (3 pts)</strong> In a random sample of 100 students,
none knew what the Poisson distribution is.  Can the hypothesis, that
1.5% of the student population knows the definition of the Poisson, be
rejected?  What if 5 students in the sample of 100 knew the definition
-- could the hypothesis be rejected?


<p><strong>5. (5 pts)</strong> Suppose we get the following sequence
of heads (H) or tails (T) from flipping a coin: <br>H T H H T H H T H
H H T T H H T H H H T T H H H H H T 
<ul>
<li>Enter the results, as a column
of letters, in SPSS. Use <tt>Transform</tt> -> <tt>Automatic
Recode</tt> to recode the results into a numerical variable. Then use
<tt>Analyze</tt> -> <tt>Reports</tt> -> <tt>Case Summaries</tt> to print the spreadsheet.
<li>Use SPSS to test whether the coin is fair. Use <tt>Analyze</tt> -> <tt>Nonparametric Tests</tt> -> <tt>Binomial</tt>. (The built-in Help topics can be useful.) Test also the hypothesis that the probability of heads for this coin is 0.6 (instead of 0.5).
</ul> 


<!--
What is the probability that at least
two people in a room of 25 people have the same birthday? Assume there
are 365 possible birthdays; i.e., the same month and date qualifies as
"the same birthday" regardless of year of birth.  (HINT: Compute 1.0
minus the probability that all the birthdays are different.)
