Homework 1. Due Tuesday, 9 Sept. 2008.

<p>1. (4 pts.) p. 32, #12. (Cf. #2 on p. 31.)


<p>2. (4 pts.) Enter the data from p. 33, #15, into SPSS.  Use
<tt>Graphs -> Interactive -> Histogram</tt> and the <tt>Histogram</tt>
tab to construct histograms as follows: <br>(a) In the histogram tab
dialogue, check the box for Set interval size automatically.  <br>(b)
In the histogram tab dialogue, UNcheck the box for Set interval size
automatically, and set the interval width to 5 (and the start width to
0).  <br>(c) In the histogram tab dialogue, UNcheck the box for Set
interval size automatically, set the interval width to 5, and set the
start width to 50%.

<p>3. (4 pts.) p. 69 #9(a).  State the definitions as in the textbook,
and also state the definitions as explained in class (and on the web
page) in terms of different formalizations of proximity.

<p>4. (5 pts.) p. 69, #11.  Use SPSS to do this. See pages 71-73 of
the textbook.

<p>5. (4 pts.) Consider this set of scores: 1, 2, 6.  <br>(a) If
distance is measured as <em>absolute</em> difference, then what is the
average distance of the value M=3.0 from the three scores? What is the
average distance of the value M=2.0 from the three scores? Which
value, 2.0 or 3.0, has the smaller average distance from the scores,
and is therefore the better representation of the central tendency?
<br>(b) If distance is measured as <em>squared</em> difference, then
what is the average distance of the value M=3.0 from the three scores?
What is the average distance of the value M=2.0 from the three scores?
Which value, 2.0 or 3.0, has the smaller average distance from the
scores, and is therefore the better representation of the central
tendency?

<p>6. (4 pts.)  Consider this set of scores: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1,
1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 16.  <br>What is the mean and standard
deviation?  What is the standardized value of the score, 5?  (That is,
what is the z-score of 5?)  <br><br>Now consider this set of scores:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B: -6, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9. <br>What is the
mean and standard deviation?  What is the standardized value of the
score, 5?  (That is, what is the z-score of 5?) <br><br>For which set
of scores, Set A or Set B, does the raw score of 5 represent a higher
score relative to the rest of the distribution? (Answer this by
considering how many scores are above or below 5 in the two
distributions.)

<!--
<p>7. (3 pts.) p. 67, #21.  Show your work, by which you compute the
standard scores.  Don't do the very last question, which asks you to
"Explain your answer to a person who has never had a course in
statistics."  Instead, answer this: When answering the question of
which ability is <em>better</em>, what assumptions have you made about
the shapes of distributions of quantitative and verbal abilities, ?
(Think about the previous problem when answering this question.)
