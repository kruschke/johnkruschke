<h2>
Cut Your Losses, Episode 2.
</h2>
</center>


<p>As you recall from our <a href="cutloss1.html">last episode</a>, we
found that the fixed number 7 was the value that yielded, in the long
run, the smallest residual variance from the sum of two rolled dice.
Residual variance was measured by the squared difference between the
rolled value and the number 7.

<p>In general, the best guess of the outcome is really a
<em>description</em> of the <em>central tendency</em> of outcomes.
When a description is formalized mathematically, it is a
<em>model</em>.

Our model is as follows: Any roll of the dice is the central tendency
plus some deviation, or residual. We denote the central tendency as
the letter M, a given outcome as y<sub>i</sub>, and the residual error
as e<sub>i</sub>.  Then our model of a given outcome is written:

<center> y<sub>i</sub> = M + e<sub>i</sub> </center>

The <em>best</em> choice for the value of M is that value which
minimizes the residuals across multiple outcomes.  So, to determine
the best value of M, we need first to decide how to measure the
residuals across multiple outcomes.


<p>In this episode of "cut your losses," we'll consider three ways to
measure residual variance, and the consequences for the best value of
M in our model.  For purposes of this exercise, the outcome we'll
consider is not the sum of the dice, but the <em>product</em> of the
dice.

<p>Now you will generate a probability distribution for the possible
outcomes of the dice.  There are 36 equally likely outcomes for a role
of the dice, as indicated in table below.  In the table, enter the
<em>product</em> of D1 and D2.
