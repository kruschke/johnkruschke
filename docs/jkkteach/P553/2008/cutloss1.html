<h2>
<p>Cut Your Losses, Episode 1.
</h2>
</center>


<p> When you roll a pair of dice, there is variability in the values
that come up, from one roll to the next.  What's the <em>best
description</em> of a typical value for the dice? A description is
also called a <em>model</em>.  We'll consider two candidate models of
the dice.  One model is simply your intuitive guess on each roll.
Another model is the fixed value 7.  For purposes of this exercise,
we'll measure the discrepancy between the model and the actual value
as the squared difference between the model prediction and the actual
value of the dice. This discrepancy is the loss you are trying to cut;
i.e., the best model should cut your losses to the minimal possible
amount.


<p>Roll the pair of dice 10 times.  Before each roll make a guess as
to the outcome. Enter the results in the table below. (An interesting
way to generate a guess is with a roll of the dice, so that you're
actually rolling the pair of dice twice for each row of the
table. This is "interesting" because in some respects the dice are a
perfect model of themselves. Another interesting way to generate a
guess is by choosing the same number - other than 7 - every time.)
Notation: Outcome of die 1 is D1, outcome of die 2 is D2.

<p>Which model, your guess or 7, yielded the lower total residual
variance?

<p>Did "7" yield the lower residual on <em>every</em> roll?  If it
did, <em>must</em> it?

<p>Did "7" yield the lower <em>total</em> residual for every person in
your discussion class?  If it did, <em>must</em> it?

Now we will generate a probability distribution for the possible
outcomes of the dice.  The goal is to understand that the most likely
value is 7, and hence to get a glimpse of why this value is the best
model of the outcome.


There are 36 equally likely outcomes for a role of the dice, as
indicated in the table at the right.  In the table, enter the sum of
D1 and D2.  <font size=-1><p>(Actually it takes a few steps to show
that each of the 36 combinations is equally likely. To wit: Each
outcome of a single die has probability 1/6; i.e., p(D1=x) = 1/6 for x
= 1,...,6, and p(D2=y) = 1/6 for y = 1,...,6.  Because the outcomes of
the two dice are independent, the probability of of any particular
combination of outcomes is the product of the individual
probabilities: p(D1=x and D2=y) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 for any x and
y.)</font>

<p>Now count the number of times each sum occurs, and enter the
frequency in the table below:

<p><center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td align=right>Sum:</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<td align=right>Frequency:</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Which sum occurs most frequently?

<p>Is the frequency distribution symmetric around that value?

<br><br>(So, perhaps now you have a somewhat better sense of why 7 is
the best guess for the sum of two dice.  This is formalized in more
detail in <a href="cutloss2.html">Episode 2</a>...)
