Homework 6. Due 17 October 2000.

</center>

<p>
In the book, <em>SPSS for Windows Step by Step</em>, see Ch. 12,
p. 131. <strong>In all SPSS analyses of variance, please include
Descriptive Statistics and the test of Homogeneity of Variance (check
the boxes within the Options menu; see pp. 134-135 of the SPSS
book). Also make a bar graph of the group means with error bars that
indicate 1 SE (use Graphs/ Interactive/ Bar/ and then the Error Bars
tab).</strong>

<ol>

<p><li>(4 pts) F distribution: Use the linked <a
href="samplef.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore sampling
distributions of <em>F</em>.  Please run the file in SPSS and do the
following.

<ul>

<li>The output includes 5 histograms of F sampling distributions. The
graphs have titles and subtitles with some missing numbers, indicated
by underlines like this: ___. Write in the appropriate values in all
the blanks. In particular, the blanks in F(__,__) refer to the
<em>df</em> for the numerator and denominator of F.

<li>The output includes 5 tables of "Descriptive Statistics." Each of
these includes the mean of EST_F_SZ, i.e., the mean of the estimated
effect size. Next to each of these output tables, write the true
effect size in the underlying population (and show how you computed
this value).

<li>The output includes 5 tables of "Frequencies/ Statistics." Each of
these includes the 90, 95 and 99 percentiles of an F sampling
distribution. If the population corresponds to a null hypothesis, then
write the corresponding critical values from the F tables (in the
textbook appendix) next to the SPSS output values. If the population
does not correspond to a null hypothesis, say so next to the SPSS
output percentiles. <br>(4 pts Extra Credit: The second of the five
cases involves three groups with equal means, sample sizes of 4 per
group, <em>and equal variances</em>. Change the three SD of the
populations to 0.33, 1.0, and 3.0. Generate the sampling distribution
and indicate what the critical values are. Do they still match the
tabled values from the back of the textbook?)

<li>For the two populations that are not null hypotheses, determine
the power of the experiments (to within the nearest 5%). Describe how
you arrived at your answer. For the case with a sample size of 10,
compare your estimate of power with the one listed in Table 11-9,
p. 341 of the textbook.


</ul>


<p><li>(3 pts.)

Suppose an experiment has three conditions with three subjects each,
with scores as follows:

<center>
<table width=100%>
<tr>
<td align=right>Group A: 1, 2, 3</td>
<td align=center>Group B: 2, 3, 4</td>
<td align=left>Group C: 5, 6, 7</td>
</tr></table>
</center>

Conduct an omnibus ANOVA completely by hand, showing your work.  Then
verify your computations with SPSS, including your printout. 

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 346, Set II, #2.  Do each part by hand, and check each part with
SPSS.  What is the proportion of variance accounted for by group
membership?  Notice that all that differs between part (a) and part (b)
is the mean of Group 2, but the <em>range</em> of group means is the
same.  What component(s) of the F statistic is affected by this
change in group mean?


<p><li>(3 pts.)

P.346, Set <strong>I</strong>, #6.  Write down the three lists of
words that you find, and indicate the length of each word.  You can
conduct the analysis in SPSS if you like. (If your dictionary does not
have as many pages as in the list of random numbers, do the following:
For each of the first 10 page numbers in the list that is within the
range of your dictionary pages, find the first noun, first verb, and
first adjective.)


<p><li>(3 pts.)

P. 347, Set II, #4.  Show your work, but do not do part (a). Do part
(b).  Do not do part (c).

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 373, Set II, #2.  Also compute R<sup>2</sup>.  Do by hand; verify
in SPSS.  Annotate how you determine R<sup>2</sup> from your SPSS
print out.

<p><li>(4 pts.)

P. 373, Set II, #5.  Verify in SPSS, using both ANOVA and
<em>t</em>-test. Annotate the corresponding parts of the ANOVA and
<em>t</em>-test print outs.
