<h2>
P553 Statistics in Psychology
<br>Homework 10: The Binomial Distribution
<br>Due Tuesday 28 November 2000.
</h2>
</center>

These exercises assume a dichotomous, nominally-scaled population,
with the probability of success denoted "p" and the sample size
denoted "N," unless otherwise stated.
Some binomial probability tables are available at
<a href="binom_table.html">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P553/binom_table.html
</a>.  Also provided on the web are some hints, at
<a href="hw10hints.html">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P553/hw10hints.html
</a>.

<p><strong>1. (4 pts)</strong> Derive (by hand, showing your
computations!) and graph three binomial distributions for p=.6: One
for N=1, a second for N=2, and a third for N=5.  Calculate the mean
and SD of each of each distribution, and mark them on the graphs.

<p><strong>2. (4 pts total)</strong> Consider a multiple-choice test with 20
questions, each of which has 5 possible answers.

<p><strong>2A. (2 pts)</strong> Suppose a student gets 7 correct.  Can
the hypothesis that the student was randomly guessing be rejected?
State whether you are conducting a directional test.

<p><strong>2B. (2 pts)</strong> Suppose a student gets just 1 correct.
Can the hypothesis of random guessing be rejected?  State whether you
are conducting a directional test.


<p><strong>3. (4 pts total)</strong> Consider a null hypothesis of
p=.5 and an alternative hypothesis of p=.7.

<p><strong>3A. (2 pts)</strong> For N=6, what is the power of the
test?

<p><strong>3B. (2 pts)</strong> If we want a power of at least .8,
what is the minimal N?


<p><strong>4. (4 pts)</strong> Suppose we have a normal population
with mean 0.0 and SD 1.0, from which we draw random, independent
samples of size 25.  Set the false alarm (type I error) rate at 5%.
If we draw 20 samples, what is the probability of getting two or more
false alarms, i.e., two or more samples with a mean that exceeds the
critical value?  (Hint: For this problem, think of "the population" as
the dichotomized sampling distribution of the mean; less than critical
value [failure] versus greater than critical value [success]. See the
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P553/hw10no4.gif"
target="new">linked diagram</a>.)


<p><strong>5. (5 pts total)</strong> 

<p><strong>5A. (2 pts)</strong> A random sample of 100 students has 54
females and 46 males.  Can the null hypothesis, that the student
population has 50% females, be rejected?

<p><strong>5B. (3 pts)</strong> In a random sample of 100 students,
none knew what the Poisson distribution is.  Can the hypothesis, that
1.5% of the student population knows the definition of the Poisson, be
rejected?  What if 5 students in the sample of 100 knew the definition
-- could the hypothesis be rejected?


<p><strong>6. (4 pts)</strong> What is the probability that at least
two people in a room of 25 people have the same birthday? Assume there
are 365 possible birthdays; i.e., the same month and date qualifies as
"the same birthday" regardless of year of birth.  (HINT: Compute 1.0
minus the probability that all the birthdays are different.)
