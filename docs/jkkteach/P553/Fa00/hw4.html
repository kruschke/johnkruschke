</center>

<p>
In the book, <em>SPSS for Windows Step by Step</em>, see Ch. 11,
p. 121. For this week, we focus on one-sample t-tests and
paired-samples t-tests. (Independent samples t-tests come later.)

<ol>

<p><strong><li>(3 pts) t distribution.</strong> Use the linked <a
href="samplezt.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore sampling
distributions of <em>z</em> and <em>t</em>. Please run the file in
SPSS and do the following.
<ul>

<li>Next to each of the first five histograms, concisely describe what
each is a histogram of.

<li>Estimated population variance: (A)&nbsp;On each histogram of the
sample variances, circle the printout of the distribution's
mean. (B)&nbsp;Mark the mean with a vertical line on each of the two
histograms. (C)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the point in the SPSS program
that specifies the variance of the <em>population</em>
distribution. (D)&nbsp;Which form of sample variance has expected
value closest to the population variance?  Annotate this on the
corresponding histogram.

<li>Critical values for <em>z</em>: (A)&nbsp;From the
<em>z</em>-tables in the textbook, what are the critical <em>z</em>
values for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and two-tailed?
(B)&nbsp;From the sampling distributions of <em>z</em> generated by
SPSS, what are the critical <em>z</em> values for a 5% type-I error
rate, one-tailed and two-tailed? (Use the percentiles listed in the
table at the top of the SPSS printout. Take the average of the
low-tail and high-tail values.)  (C)&nbsp;With vertical lines, mark
the textbook critical values and the SPSS-generated critical values on
the second <em>z</em> histogram; i.e., on the next-to-last histogram.

<li>Critical values for <em>t</em>: (A)&nbsp;From the
<em>t</em>-tables in the textbook, what are the critical <em>z</em>
values for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and two-tailed? <em>What
df do you use?</em> (B)&nbsp;From the sampling distributions of
<em>t</em> generated by SPSS, what are the critical <em>t</em> values
for a 5% type-I error rate, one-tailed and two-tailed? (Use the
percentiles listed in the table at the top of the SPSS printout. Take
the average of the low-tail and high-tail values.)  (C)&nbsp;With
vertical lines, mark the textbook critical values and the
SPSS-generated critical values on the second <em>t</em> histogram;
i.e., on the last histogram.

</ul>


<p><strong><li>(3 pts) Power of t-test.</strong>

Use the linked <a href="powert.sps">SPSS syntax file</a> to explore
the power of a <em>t</em> test. Please run the file in SPSS and do the
following.  

<ul>

<li>Critical value of <em>t</em> from null hypothesis: (A)&nbsp;What
is the sample size used in this program? What are the <em>df</em> in
this case?  (B)&nbsp;From Table 9-1, p. 261, or from the Appendix in
the textbook, report the critical <em>t</em> values for a one-tailed
test with Type-I error rates of 10%, 5% or 1%. Make sure you use the
correct <em>df</em>.  (C)&nbsp;On the SPSS printout of percentiles,
circle and annotate the corresponding critical values for <em>t</em>.
(D)&nbsp;On the second histogram (i.e., the graph with x-axis range -3
to 7), mark these correct and SPSS-estimated critical values, using
vertical lines.

<li>Power for small effect size.  (A)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the
part of the SPSS program that specifies a population distribution with
a small effect size (d=.2).  (B)&nbsp;Using the SPSS output table,
estimate the percentile, in this alternative hypothesis sampling
distribution, of the 5%-critical value in the null hypothesis sampling
distribution. What, therefore, is the power of this test?
(C)&nbsp;Find the corresponding power listed in Table 9-9, p. 278, and
report it.  (D)&nbsp;On the fourth graph, mark the 5% critical value
with a vertical line, and mark the area of the histogram that
corresponds to the power of the test. (Notice that the <em>t</em>
distribution is not symmetrical.)

<li>Power for moderate effect size.  (A)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the
part of the SPSS program that specifies a population distribution with
a small effect size (d=.5).  (B)&nbsp;Using the SPSS output table,
estimate the percentile, in this alternative hypothesis sampling
distribution, of the 5%-critical value in the null hypothesis sampling
distribution. What, therefore, is the power of this test?
(C)&nbsp;Find the corresponding power listed in Table 9-9, p. 278, and
report it.  (D)&nbsp;On the sixth graph, mark the 5% critical value
with a vertical line, and mark the area of the histogram that
corresponds to the power of the test. (Notice that the <em>t</em>
distribution is not symmetrical.)

<li>Power for large effect size.  (A)&nbsp;Circle and annotate the
part of the SPSS program that specifies a population distribution with
a small effect size (d=.8).  (B)&nbsp;Using the SPSS output table,
estimate the percentile, in this alternative hypothesis sampling
distribution, of the 5%-critical value in the null hypothesis sampling
distribution. What, therefore, is the power of this test?
(C)&nbsp;Find the corresponding power listed in Table 9-9, p. 278, and
report it.  (D)&nbsp;On the eighth graph, mark the 5% critical value
with a vertical line, and mark the area of the histogram that
corresponds to the power of the test. (Notice that the <em>t</em>
distribution is not symmetrical.)

part (c); i.e., give the effect size.  Also, what is the approximate
power of this test?

<p><strong><li>(3 pts) </strong> p. 286, set II, #4.  Assume a

<strong><li>(3 pts) Why SPSS tells you about the correlation when
you do a paired-samples t-test,</strong>

Consider a group of people who attend a self-help seminar. At the
beginning an end of the seminar the people are asked to provide a
rating of self-confidence, on a scale of 1 to 12. The results from
nine people are shown in the table at right.  Enter these data into
SPSS, and then compute the difference scores for each subject (use
menu Transform/Compute...; see p. 48+ of SPSS book).

<ul>

<li>Do a one-sample t-test on the difference scores. Can we reject the
null hypothesis that the self-help seminar has no effect on mean
self-confidence?

<li>Do a paired-samples t-test on the after and before scores. Can we
reject the null hypothesis that the self-help seminar has no effect on
mean self-confidence?

<li>The two tests (one-sample and paired-sample) should agree
exactly. Do they?

<li>Is there a significant relationship between the before and after
scores? The answer is YES, despite the fact that there is not a
significant difference in the means before and after. What is the
relationship and where is this indicated in the SPSS t-test output?
(Hint: Consider a scattergram of the before and after scores. What
happens to people who start off with low self-confidence? What happens
to people who start off with high self-confidence? Would you recommend
this seminar to someone who is already feeling pretty good?)

</ul>

<p><strong><li>(3 pts) Confidence intervals in SPSS.</strong>

How did SPSS compute the confidence interval (CI) for the previous
problem? The answer: Recall that for <em>z</em>-scores, the CI is
M-z<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub> to
M+z<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub>. SPSS computes the CI for <em>t</em>
in the analogous way, as M-t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub> to
M+t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub>. Let's verify that this matches the
output provided by SPSS:

<ul>
<li>What is M in this case? (The answer is 3.0. Mark and annotate this on
the SPSS printout.)

<li>What is SE<sub>M</sub> in this case? (The answer is 1.7078. Mark and
annotate this on the SPSS printout.)

<li>What is t<sub>crit</sub> in this case? Look it up (for 8 df, 5%,
two-tailed).

<li>Verify that the CI in the SPSS output is
M-t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub> to
M+t<sub>crit</sub>SE<sub>M</sub>. That is, write down these formulas
and show the equivalence with the SPSS confidence interval.

</ul>

<p>
It turns out that this CI computed by SPSS is only an approximation to
the true CI. Use the linked <a href="confintt.sps">SPSS syntax
file</a> to see why. Run the file in SPSS and do the following:

<ul>

<li>Why does the program specify the population distributions to have
SD=5.1235?

<li>Why does the program specify one population to have M=-0.9387 and
the other to have M=6.9383?

<li>In each of the two graphs, draw a vertical line at the <em>t</em>
value for the mean difference obtained in the previous exercise.

<li>What is the approximate percentile of this <em>t</em> value in the
first distribution? In the second?  Are these percentiles extremely
close to 97.5 and 2.5, as they should be if the confidence interval
limits from SPSS are correct?

<li>Why are the true CI limits a little narrower than reported by
SPSS? (Notice that the true sampling distributions are skewed; i.e.,
asymmetric, whereas SPSS reported a symmetric CI.)
