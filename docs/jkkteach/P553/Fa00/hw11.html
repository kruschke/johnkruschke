Homework 11: The Chi-Square Distribution. Due 5 December 2000.
</h2>
</center>

<p><strong>1. (4 pts)</strong> Compute and graph the discrete Pearson
chi-square distributions for df=2 with N=4 and with N=5.  Also
determine the mean of each distribution.  (See a <a
href="chisquare.html">linked page</a> for a discussion of method.)

<p><strong>2. (3 pts)</strong> Aron and Aron text p.455, Set
II, <strong>#1</strong>.  <br>Why is the expected distribution in Part
(a) interesting?

<p> <strong>3. (3 pts)</strong> Aron and Aron text p.456, Set
II, <strong>#3</strong>. <br>Do <em>not</em> bother to "explain your
answer to a person who has never taken a course in statistics."

<p> <strong>4. (4 pts)</strong> Aron and Aron text p.457, Set II,
<strong>#4</strong>.  <br>Is the influence of the increasingly large
cell greater for the 2x2 tables or for the 3x3 tables?

<p> <strong>5. (11 pts total)</strong>

<p><strong>5A (3 pts):</strong> A researcher wants to know
whether the sex of the first child from a couple is independent of the
sex of the second-born child from the same couple.  The researcher
compiles birth records from 100 families and finds the following
results:

<pre>
                1st born
                 M    F
      2nd    M  30   20
      born   F  20   30
</pre>

Can the researcher reject the null hypthesis of independence?  Show
your by-hand computations.


<p> <strong>5B (3 pts):</strong> The researcher wants to know
whether the proportional birth rates of boys and girls are equal.  She
consulted statistical records of large families and compiled results
from 1000 families with 7 children.  The researcher counted the number
of families with 0 girls, the number with 1 girl, and so on, and found
these results:

<pre>    
       r    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     freq  42 125 171 162 162 171 125  42
</pre>    

The researcher compared this obtained frequency distribution against
the expected <em>binomial</em> distribution.  Can the null hypothesis
be rejected? 

<p> <strong>5C (3 pts):</strong> The researcher realized that the
data in Part B can be used much more simply to test the same
hypothesis.  Just determine the total number of girls in the sample of
7000 children, and see if it differs significantly from 3500.  Can the
null hypothesis be rejected?

<p> <strong>5D (2 pts):</strong> Don't the conclusions from Parts B
and C conflict?  How can the apparent difference be resolved?  (HINT:
One possibility comes from Part A -- think about the assumptions in
deriving the expected frequency distribution for part B.) Compare the
observed frequency distribution of part B against an expected
frequency distribution generated as follows: Suppose that the
population consists equally of two types of couples (parents).  One
type has 70% girls, and the other type has 30% girls.  In each type,
the sexes of successive children are independent.  Thus, the overall
distribution of sexes is a mixture of two binomial distributions, one
for p=.7 and one for p=.3.  Can this hypothesis be rejected?
