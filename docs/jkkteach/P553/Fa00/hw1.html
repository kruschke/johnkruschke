<p>1. (3 pts.) p. 29, Set II, #1.

<p>2. (4 pts.) p. 29, Set II, #2.  Make the graphs, etc., <em>by hand.</em>

<p>3. (3 pts.) Using the data from p. 29, Set II, #2, make two grouped
histograms <em>in SPSS</em>, for two different numbers of intervals.

<p>4. (4 pts.) p. 59, Set II, #1.  State the definitions as in the
textbook, and also state the definitions as explained in class (and on
the web page) in terms of different formalizations of proximity.

<p>5. (4 pts.) p. 59, Set II, #2.  Use SPSS to do this. The
<tt>Frequencies</tt> command has a <tt>Statistics</tt> suboption that
will provide the needed analysis.  See SPSS Ch. 6.  Include your
printout with your homework.

<p>6. (4 pts.) 
Consider this set of scores:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A:  1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 16.
<br>What is the mean and standard deviation?  What is the standardized
value of the score, 5?  (That is, what is the z-score of 5?)
<br><br>Now consider this set of scores:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B:   -6, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9.
<br>What is the mean and standard deviation?  What is the standardized
value of the score, 5?  (That is, what is the z-score of 5?)
<br><br>For which set of scores, Set A or Set B, does the raw score of
5 represent a <em>better</em> score relative to the rest of the distribution?
Answer this by considering how many scores are above or below 5 
in the two distributions.

<p>7. (3 pts.) p. 60, Set II, #6. Show your work, by which you compute
the standard scores.  Don't do the very last question, which asks you
to "Explain your answer to a person who has never had a course in
statistics."  Instead, answer this: What assumptions have you made
about the shapes of distributions of quantitative and verbal
abilities, when answering the question of which ability is
<em>better</em>? (Think about the previous problem when answering this
question.)
