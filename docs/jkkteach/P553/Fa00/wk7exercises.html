<p>Suppose we flip two independent fair coins; say, a nickel and a dime.

<p>Suppose we flip each coin once.  What is the probability
distribution of the difference between the outcomes; i.e., what is the
probability distribution of #heads on nickel minus #heads on dime?

<p>Suppose we flip each coin twice.  What is the probability
distribution of the difference between the outcomes; i.e., what is the
probability distribution of #heads on nickel minus #heads on dime?

<p>Suppose I flip each coin twice.  On the nickel I get two heads.  On
the dime I get two tails.  Is it reasonable to assume that the two
coins have the same underlying probability of getting a head; that is,
is the probability of this outcome greater than .05?

<p>Hints: To answer these questions, it might help to make a table of
the possible outcomes, like the tables of outcomes of two dice in
earlier homeworks or labs.  On the margins of the table, put the
#heads of each coin, along with the probability of getting that
#heads.  In the body of the table, put the difference of the #heads,
and the probability of getting that difference.  Then combine cells
with the same difference of the #heads.
