P553 Statistics in Psychology, Prof. Kruschke<br>

<h2>
Sample Exam 2
</h2>
</center>

<p>The exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged to
use a calculator (and you may also bring along the calculator manual).
Tables of critical values and of power are provided separately.  There
are 100 points possible, with points for each problem as marked.  You
have 75 minutes; please allocate your time carefully.

Suppose we measure "feeling of contentment" of students before and
after taking a statistics exam.  Feeling of contentment is rated on a
scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high).  Suppose we have a null hypothesis
that feelings of contentment will not change during the exam.  The
alternative hypothesis is that feeling of contentment will change (so
this is a non-directional, two-tailed test).  For nine students
selected at random, the before and after ratings are as shown in the
table at the right.

<p><strong>(a, 5 pts)</strong> Estimate the effect size (of the
change in feeling).


<p><strong>(b, 10 pts)</strong> Can the null hypothesis be rejected?
(Assume alpha = .05.)

<p>For the next parts of this problem, determine whether before and
after scores are significantly correlated:

<p><strong>(c, 10 pts).</strong> State the definition of the Pearson
correlation.  Compute the correlation of the before and after scores.

<p><strong>(d, 10 pts).</strong> Suppose we have a null hypothesis
that feelings of contentment before and after the exam are completely
uncorrelated.  Test this hypothesis, assuming a two-tailed test and a
significance level of .05.

<p><strong>(e, 6 pts).</strong> What assumptions have you made in
conducting the test and <em>why</em>?

<p><strong>(f, 4 pts).</strong> What is the effect size and
approximate power of the test?





<p><strong>
<li> (20 pts. total):
</strong> 

<p><strong>(a, 10 pts).</strong> Test whether the means of the following
three groups differ. Use a significance level of 5%.
<br>Group 1: 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 
<br>Group 2: 13.0, 15.0, 17.0
<br>Group 3: 6.0, 9.0, 12.0 

<p><strong>(b, 3 pts).</strong> What assumptions have you made in
conducting the test?

<p><strong>(c, 2 pts).</strong> What is the proportion of total
variance accounted for by the difference of group means?

<p><strong>(d, 5 pts).</strong> What is the effect size and
approximate power of the test?


<p><strong><li> (20 pts. total):</strong>
 
<p><strong>(a, 10 pts).</strong> Test whether the means of the
following two groups differ.  Use a two-tailed <em>t</em>-test, with
significance level of .05.  <br>Group 1:
17.0, 21.0, 24.0 <br>Group 2: 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, 18.0

<p><strong>(b, 3 pts).</strong> What assumptions have you made in
conducting the test?

<p><strong>(c, 2 pts).</strong> What is the effect size and
approximate power of the test?

<p><strong>(d, 5 pts).</strong> If you were to test the difference
between group means using ANOVA instead of a <em>t</em>-test, what
would be the value of F, and what would be the relevant degrees of
freedom?

<p><strong>
<li> (15 pts. total):
</strong>

Draw pictures of population and sampling distributions to illustrate
effect size and power for <em>t</em>, F, and <em>r</em>.
