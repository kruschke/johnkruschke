<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p> <li>(5 pts.) For the data in #1, Set II, p. 95, do the following <strong>by
hand and show your work</strong>:

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation (use either the defining formula or the
computational formula).

<li>Test the null hypothesis (convert <em>r</em> to <em>t</em>).

<li>Determine the approximate power (Table 3-12, p. 99).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X).

<li>Determine the linear regression equation.

<li>What is the predicted anxiety scores for a person with a dexterity
score of zero?  And for a person with a dexterity score of 3?

<li>Plot the data, with the best fitting regression line.

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
<li>(5 pts.) For the data in #2, Set II, p. 95 (data actually on p. 96), do the
following <strong>by hand and show your work</strong>:

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation (use either the defining formula or the
computational formula).

<li>Test the null hypothesis (convert <em>r</em> to <em>t</em>).

<li>Determine the approximate power (Table 3-12, p. 99).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X).

<li>Determine the linear regression equation.

<li>What is the predicted value of number of violent acts for a child
who watches no television?  And for a child who watches 1 hour of TV
per week?

<li>Plot the data, with the best fitting regression line.

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(5 pts.) For the data in #3, Set II, p. 96, do the following <strong>in
SPSS</strong>. (The second data column should be headed "Y" instead of
"X.")

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation. Highlight/mark the print-out where this
is shown.

<li>Test the null hypothesis. Highlight/mark the print-out where this
is shown.

<li>Determine the approximate power (Table 3-12, p. 99).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X). Highlight/mark the print-out where this is shown.

<li>Determine the linear regression equation. Highlight/mark the
print-out where this is shown.

<li>What is the predicted value of number of people stopping to look
for a painting that is just done (zero years old)?  And for a painting
that is 1,000 years old?

<li>Plot the data, with the best fitting regression line.

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(5 pts.) For the data in #4, Set II, p. 96, do the following <strong>in
SPSS</strong>. (The second data column should be headed "Y" instead of
"X.")

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation. Highlight/mark the print-out where this
is shown.

<li>Test the null hypothesis. Highlight/mark the print-out where this
is shown.

<li>Determine the approximate power (Table 3-12, p. 99).

<li>Compute the proportion of variance (in Y) accounted for (by
variance in X). Highlight/mark the print-out where this is shown.

<li>Determine the linear regression equation. Highlight/mark the
print-out where this is shown.

<li>What is the predicted value of score on achievement test for a
person with a neatness rating of zero?  And for a person with a
neatness rating of 10?

<li>Plot the data, with the best fitting regression line.

</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(3 pts.) P. 132, Set II, #5.  Instead of "explaining these results to
someone who has never had exposure to regression," briefly explain the
importance of each beta value under "Retribution" in Table 4-11.  Also
explain the meaning of the R<sup>2</sup> value in the "Retribution"
column.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><li>(2 pts.) P. 132, Set II, #6.
