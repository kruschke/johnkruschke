Homework 2, Due 14 Sept. 1999.

<p>1. (3 pts.) p. 29, Set II, #1.

<p>2. (3 pts.) p. 29, Set II, #2.  Make the graphs, etc., by hand.

<p>3. (2 pts.) Using the data from p. 29, Set II, #2, make two grouped
histograms in SPSS, for two different numbers of intervals.

<p>4. (3 pts.) p. 59, Set II, #1.  State the definitions as in the
textbook, and also state the definitions as explained in class (and on
the web page) in terms of different formalizations of proximity.

<p>5. (2 pts.) p. 59, Set II, #2.  Use SPSS to do this. (SPSS might not
have SS and variance and SD in its printout, but it will have at least
one, from which you can compute the others.) Include your printout.

<p>6. (2 pts.) p. 60, Set II, #6. Show your work, by which you compute
the standard scores.  Don't do the very last question, which asks you
to "Explain your answer to a person who has never had a course in
statistics."  Instead, answer this: What assumptions have you made
about the shapes of distributions of quantitative and verbal
abilities, when answering the question of which ability is <em>better</em>?

<p>7. (3 pts.) 
Consider this set of scores:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A:  1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 16.
<br>What is the mean and standard deviation?  What is the standardized
value of the score, 9?  (That is, what is the z-score of 9?)
<br><br>Now consider this set of scores:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B:   -6, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9.
<br>What is the mean and standard deviation?  What is the standardized
value of the score, 9?  (That is, what is the z-score of 9?)
<br><br>For which set of scores, Set A or Set B, does the raw score of
9 represent a <em>better</em> score relative to the rest of the distribution?
Answer this by considering how many scores are above or below 9, 
in the two distributions.

<p>8. (2 pts.)  Suppose we model a population as a normal distribution
with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.  Determine the maximal
likelihood estimates of mu and sigma for the following two sets of
scores sampled from the modeled population:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B: 1, 3, 3, 3, 5.

<p>9. (3 pts.) Suppose we model a population of integer values as a
<strong>uniform</strong> distribution.  The shape of a uniform
distribution is rectangular.  An example is the probability
distribution of a fair, six-sided die.  In general, the probability of
a score is zero until the value gets up to <em>min</em>, at which
point the probability rises to a fixed level until the value of the
score gets to <em>max+1</em>, at which point the probability drops to
zero again.  Because the total probability of all possible values must
add to 1.0, the fixed level of probability between <em>min</em> and
<em>max</em> is 1/(<em>max</em>+1-<em>min</em>). For example, in the
case of the fair six-sided die, <em>min</em>=1, <em>max</em>=6, and
the probability of values from 1 to 6 is 1/6.  Consider the following
scores: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  <br>If we let
<em>min</em>=0 and <em>max</em>=10, what is the probability of the
scores in Set A?  If we let <em>min</em>=2 and <em>max</em>=4, what is
the probability of the scores in Set A?  What are the maximal
likelihood estimates of <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> for the scores
in Set A?  What are the maximal likelihood estimates of <em>min</em>
and <em>max</em> for the scores in Set B?  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set B: 1,
3, 3, 3, 5.  <br>(For your personal edification, compare these results
with the previous exercise.)



<p>10. (2 pts.) Suppose someone claims that a certain six-sided die,
(with sides numbered 1 through 6) is biased, such that the probability
of rolling the die and getting the side with value <em>x</em> is
<em>x<sup>2</sup>/91</em>.  Suppose that we roll the die twice and get value
1 both times.  What is the probability of this happening, given the
claim?  Do you disbelieve the claim?  Suppose that an alternative claim
is that the probability of rolling value <em>x</em> is (7-x)/21.  What
is the probability of getting two rolls of 1, given this alternative
claim?  Do you disbelieve the alternative claim?
