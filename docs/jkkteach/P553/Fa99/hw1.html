Homework 1. Due Tuesday, 7 Sept., 1999.

</center>

These questions regard information from the Preface, Ch. 1, Ch. 2,
Ch. 8 and Ch. 9 of <em>The New Know-Nothings</em> by Morton Hunt.
Several of the questions ask about dates, the purpose of these
questions being to emphasize the recency of many of these events.

<ol>

<li> (3 pts.)  Was Trofim Lysenko for or against the genetic theory of
traits?  Did the Central Committee of the Communist Party approve of
or disavow Lysenko's report?  Until what year was genetic research
squelched in the Soviet Union? Until what year was psychoanalysis
squelched in the Soviet Union (and its successor)?

<!-- Against, p. x.  
     Approve - until 1965, p. 10, 1st par.
     1996, p. 10, 3rd par. -->


<p><li> (1 pt.) What is the origin of the doctrine of "informed consent"?

<!-- Nuremberg Tribunal, p. 13 -->


<p><li> (1 pt.) In what year did HEW (later HHS) require funded
institutions to establish Institutional Review Boards?

<!-- 1974, p. 15 -->


<p><li> (4 pts.) According to M. Hunt, what are the four main reasons
for the rise of opposition to research in America in recent decades?
(Only brief answer needed.)

<!-- success of confrontational methods in 60s and 70s
     loss of faith in democratic system and rise of special interest groups
     distrust and fear of science and technology
     rise of arch-conservatives in federal government in 90s  -->


<p><li> (1 pt.) In what year did Supreme Courst Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes write, "It is better for all the world, if ... society can
prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind."

<!-- 1927, p. 36 -->

<!--

<p><li> (2 pts.) Suppose a scientist claims that, say, whites have
higher intelligence than blacks.  What logical steps should be
involved in making the claim?  (Specifically, briefly discuss the
steps of sampling, designing a dependent variable, and assessing a
difference between groups.)  If, moreover, the scientist claims that
the difference is attributable to genetics and not environment, what
other steps are involved? (Specifically, briefly discuss factorial
manipulation.)

-->

<!-- The samples must be random and representative of the two
populations, and controlled if necessary for other factors such as age
and education.  The dependent variable, i.e., measure of intelligence,
must not be biased for or against one of the populations.  Any
observed difference in average intelligence must be assessed for
significance by statistical analysis, which itself relies on a number
of assumptions.  To attribute a difference to particular factors, the
various factors must be independently manipulated.  This is difficult
if not impossible to do experimentally in this case, and so can only
be observed as it happens to exist "in the field."  -->

<p><li> (1 pts.) In what year was the National Science Foundation
established?  Eight years later, what percentage of its budget was for
social science?

<!-- 1950, p.241; 1.2%, p.242 -->


<p><li>  (1 pts.) In 1980, what percentage cut of social science funding
at NSF was recommended by David Stockman and Ronald Reagan?

<!-- 75%, p.245 -->


<p><li> (1 pts.) In what year did John Kasich, chairman of the House
Budget Committee, propose to eliminate funding for the Social,
Behavioral and Economic Directorate of NSF?

<!-- 1995, p.248-249 -->


<p><li> (2 pts.)  What is the defining mission of NSF? (See the NSF
web page <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/home/about/creation.htm">
http://www.nsf.gov/home/about/creation.htm</a> There you will find a
one sentence description of their mission.)  Do you think that social
research is part of this mission?  Why or why not?  (Only brief answer
needed.)

<!-- the NSF's mission: To promote the progress of science; to advance
the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the
national defense. -->


<p><li> (2 pts.)  Does Hunt claim that all recovered memories are
false?  Does he mention any cases of confirmed abuse?  If so, cite at
least one page and quote or summarize the mentioning.

<!-- No.  Yes, he mentions some confirmed cases.  E.g., on p.268. -->


<p><li> (3 pts.) Hunt identifies three groups who oppose researchers
like Loftus.  What are these three groups, and why does each oppose
Loftus' type of research? (Only brief answer needed.)

<!-- p.268 militant feminists, recovered memory therapists, survivors -->


<p><li> (2 pts).  What was the first mental health research grant from
the Division of Mental Hygiene, the precursor of the National
Institutes of Mental Health? Specify the year, the researcher, and the
university.  (Hint: See the NIMH history web page, <a
href="http://www.nih.gov/welcome/almanac/organization/nimh/history.html">
http://www.nih.gov/welcome/almanac/organization/nimh/history.html</a>.)

<!-- 1947--On July 1 the first mental health research grant (MH-1) was
awarded to Dr.  Winthrop N. Kellogg of Indiana University by the
Division of Mental Hygiene. It was titled "Basic Nature of the
Learning Process." -->


<p><li> (3 pts.) Briefly describe <em>your own</em> research. What are
its potential helpful and harmful consequences?  What political
adversaries might the research encounter?  Think broadly about this
one.
