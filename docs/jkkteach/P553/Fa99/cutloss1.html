<p> When you roll a pair of dice, there is variability in the values
that come up, from one roll to the next.  What's the best model of
this variability?  We'll consider two candidate models.  One "model"
is simply your intuitive guess on each roll.  Another model is
the fixed value 7.  For reasons to be divulged later in the course,
we'll measure the amount of residual variance as the squared
difference between the model prediction and the actual value of the
dice.


<p>Roll the dice 10 times.  Before each roll make a guess as to the
outcome. Enter the results in the table below. (Actually, an
interesting way to generate a guess is with a roll of the dice, so
that you're actually rolling the dice twice for each row of the
table. This is "interesting" because in some respects the dice are a
perfect model of themselves. Another interesting way to generate a
guess is by choosing the same number - other than 7 - every time.)
Notation: Outcome of die 1 is D1, outcome of die 2 is D2.

<p>Which model, your guess or 7, yielded the lower total residual
variance?

<p>Did "7" yield the lower residual on <em>every</em> roll?  If it
did, <em>must</em> it?

<p>Did "7" yield the lower <em>total</em> residual for every person in
your discussion class?  If it did, <em>must</em> it?

<p><hr width=70%>

<p>Now we will generate a probability distribution for the possible
outcomes of the dice.  The goal is to understand that the most likely
value is 7, and hence get a glimpse of why this value is the best
model for the outcome.


<p>There are 36 equally likely outcomes for a role of the dice, as
indicated in table below.  In the table, enter the sum of D1 and D2.
<font size=-1>(Actually it takes a few steps to show that each of the 36
combinations is equally likely. To wit: Each outcome of a single die
has probability 1/6; i.e., p(D1=x) = 1/6 for x = 1,...,6, and p(D2=y)
= 1/6 for y = 1,...,6.  Because the outcomes of the two dice are
independent, the probability of of any particular combination of
outcomes is the product of the individual probabilities: p(D1=x and
D2=y) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 for any x and y.)</font>

<p>Now count the number of times each sum occurs, and enter the
frequency in the table below:

<p><center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td align=right>Sum:</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<td align=right>Frequency:</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Which sum occurs most frequently?

<p>Is the frequency distribution symmetric around that value?

<br><br>(So, perhaps now you have a somewhat better sense of why 7 is
the best guess for the sum of two dice.  This is formalized in more
detail <a href="cutloss2.html">next time</a>...)
