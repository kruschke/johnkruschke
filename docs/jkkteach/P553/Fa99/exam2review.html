Be sure to review the <a href="goals.html#wk6">instructional goals</a> of
weeks 6-10.<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>t-tests of a single sample mean:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>For t-tests, know about effect size, power and sample
size, and be able to conduct a t-test (and know when to do so; see the
<a href="dectree.html">decision tree</a> for tests considered so
far).  Know about single-sample t-tests and paired-samples t-tests.

	</ul>

<li><strong><em>t</em>-tests of two independent means:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to conduct the test (by hand).  Know how to do
	one- or two-tailed tests.  Know how to handle unequal sample
	sizes in the two groups.

	<li>Know the assumptions of the test.

	<li>Be able to compute effect size and approximate power.

	</ul>

<li><strong>One Way ANOVA:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to conduct the test (by hand).  Is ANOVA a one- or
	a two-tailed test?

	<li>Know the assumptions of the test.

	<li>Be able to compute effect size and approximate power.

	<li>Know about proportion of variance accounted for.

	</ul>

<li><strong>Bilinear correlation and regression:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Be able to compute correlation and test its significance
	(by hand).  Know how to do one- or two-tailed tests.

	<li>Know the assumptions of the test.

	<li>Be able to compute effect size and approximate power.

	<li>Know about proportion of variance accounted for.

	</ul>

<li><strong>General Linear Model:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know that t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression are all
	cases of the general linear model.

	<li>Know the general form of the F statistic.

	<li>In multiple linear regression, know how to interpret the
	computer output, including the regression equation.

	</ul>

</ul>
