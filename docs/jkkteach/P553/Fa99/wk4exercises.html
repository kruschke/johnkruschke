<p><li><strong>Normal distribution as a model for residuals.</strong>
Suppose we have a set of scores <center>4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8,
8.</center> We believe that a good model for the population from which
these scores were drawn is a central tendency, mu, with normally
distributed deviations with mean zero and variance sigma**2.
Formally, this can be written <center>Y<sub>i</sub> = mu +
e<sub>i</sub>, with e<sub>i</sub> drawn from
N(0,sigma**2)</center>where Y<sub>i</sub> is the i-th score, mu is the
central tendency of the population, e<sub>i</sub> is the residual of
the i-th score, and N(0,sigma**2) is a normal distribution with mean
zero and variance sigma**2.  <p>What is our best estimate of the
parameter mu?  <p>What is our best estimate of the parameter sigma**2?
