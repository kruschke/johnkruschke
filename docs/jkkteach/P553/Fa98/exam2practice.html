<br>Practice Exam 2
</h2>
<p>(This is now ready. Updated Monday 11/02/98, 9:40am.)
</center>



<p> The exam will not be this long, but it will have problems like
these.  <em>You are encouraged to discuss these questions, and even
post answers or candidate answers, on the <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/p553_bbs/p553.cgi">Discussion
web page</a>.</em> Do not turn in answers to these problems.  This is
not a homework assignment.  There is no homework assignment this week,
other than doing these problems for your own review.


<p>For some of these exercises, you will need to use the Tables of
<em>z</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>F</em> and <em>power</em> in
the Appendices of the textbook.  Copies of these tables will be
supplied during the exam.

<p><li>For normal population with mean = 6.0, SD = 2.5, and sample
size n = 20, what is the probability that the sample mean will be
greater than 7.0?  Greater than 5.0?

<p><li>For IQ scores, the population is normal with mean = 100 and SD
= 15.  Consider two random samples, with n1 = 20 and n2 = 100.  Which
sample is more likely to have a sample mean greater than 110?  Greater
than 90?

<p><li>Suppose for a sample with n = 40, the sample mean is 6.0 and
the sample SS is 3078.  Compute the best estimate of the population
mean and the 95% confidence interval.  What assumptions have you made
in computing this interval?

<p><li>Suppose for a sample with n = 20, the sample mean is 6.0 and
the sample SS is 1539.  Compute the best estimate of the population
mean and the 95% confidence interval.  What assumptions have you made
in computing this interval?

<p><li>In a sample of n = 20, the 95% confidence interval for the mean
was 875 to 955.  What was the estimated standard error fo the mean?
What was the estimated standard deviation of the population?

<p><li>Suppose we have samples from two conditions, with statistics as follows.
<br>Group A: n = 18, mean = 6.89, SS = 49.78
<br>Group B: n = 18, mean = 8.61, SS = 70.28
<br>Compute the 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means.
What assumptions have you made?

<p><li>For samples from two conditions, each with n = 20, the
difference of sample means was 8.70.  In testing the null hypothesis,
<em>t</em> = 2.30.  What was the estimated standard error of the
difference of means?  What was the estimated standard deviation of the
underlying groups in the population?

<p><li>Here are data of samples from two conditions:
<br>Group A: 1, 2, 2, 3.
<br>Group B: 3, 4, 4, 5.
<br>What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference of means?
Conduct a t-test of the null hypothesis.  What assumptions did you
make for the test?  What is Cohen's d? What is R<sup>2</sup>?

<p><li>Here are data of samples from two conditions:
<br>Group A: 1, 4, 4, 9.
<br>Group B: 9, 16, 16, 25.
<br>* What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference of means?
Conduct a t-test of the null hypothesis.  What assumptions did you
make for the test?  What is Cohen's d? What is R<sup>2</sup>?
<br>* To alleviate any doubt that the assumptions of the t-test are
satisfied, transform all the scores with a square-root
function. Are the assumptions of the t-test better satisfied with the
transformed scores?  Conduct a t-test; are the conclusions the same? 
(HINT: See the previous problem.)

<p><li>A sample of n = 21 is taken from each of three conditions.  The
samples show these statistics:
<br>Group A: mean = 13.7, SS = 158.
<br>Group B: mean = 12.6, SS = 161.
<br>Group C: mean = 8.2, SS = 193.
<br>* Calculate Tukey's HSD and find 95% confidence intervals for the
three differences between means.  Which means are significantly different?
<br>* Complete an ANOVA summary table. What is the critical F for a 5%
type-I error rate?  What is R<sup>2</sup>?  What is the conclusion of
the omnibus ANOVA and what assumptions have you made?
<br>* What is Fisher's LSD?  Which means are significantly different?

<p><li>Samples are taken from three conditions, with raw scores as follows:
<br>Group A: 20, 22, 23, 23
<br>Group B: 21, 23, 25, 27
<br>Group C: 26, 28, 30, 30
<br>* Calculate Tukey's HSD and find 95% confidence intervals for the
three differences between means.  Which means are significantly different?
<br>* Complete an ANOVA summary table. What is the critical F for a 5%
type-I error rate?  What is R<sup>2</sup>?  What is the conclusion of
the omnibus ANOVA and what assumptions have you made?
<br>* What is Fisher's LSD?  Which means are significantly different?


<p><li>For samples from two conditions, summary statistics were as follows.
<br>Group A: n = 12, mean = 9.74, SS = 2218.
<br>Group B: n = 12, mean = 6.63, SS = 2874.
<br>* Conduct a t-test of the null hypothesis.
<br>* Assuming that the true difference between means is the observed
difference between sample means, what is the power of the test?
<br>* What is the smallest sample size per group that would yield a
power of .8 ?

<p><li>Suppose someone claims that two different populations differ in
IQ by an average of 5 points.  In both populations, IQ scores are
normally distributed with an SD of 15 points.  Suppose you want to
challenge the claim, as you believe that there is no significant
difference in mean IQ.  What sample size would you need to detect a
mean difference of 5 points with power of .9 ?

<p><li>Suppose your universal theory of how things work predicts that
condition B should exceed condition A by a mean score of 10.0.  A
competing theorist tests your theory by randomly sampling the two
conditions, and she comes up with these data:
<br>Group A: 1, 11, 21, 31, 41.
<br>Group B: 11, 21, 31, 41, 51.
<br>On the basis of these data, the competing theorist concludes that
your theory's prediction is disconfirmed.  How might you rebutt the
conclusion?  More specifically, using these data to estimate the SD in the
population, how big of a sample size (per group) would be needed to
detect your claimed difference with a power of .9?
