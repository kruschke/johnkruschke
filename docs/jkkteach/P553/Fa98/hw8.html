<p>Enter the following data into Minitab.  There are three groups of
four subjects each.  Nominal codings for the groups are also
specified.

<pre>
score group code12 code13 wt12 wt13
1     1     0      0      1    1
2     1     0      0      1    1
3     1     0      0      1    1
4     1     0      0      1    1
6     2     1      0      1    0

<p><strong>1. (17 pts)</strong>

<ul>

<p><li>1.1. (3 pts.) Conduct an ANOVA on score as a function of group
(use the "<tt>oneway</tt>" command).

<p><li>1.2. (3 pts.) Use "<tt>glm</tt>" to conduct the same analysis. Have it
print the group means, too (use the "<tt>means</tt>" subcommand).

<p><li>1.3 (3 pts.). Test the difference of the first two groups: Use
"<tt>glm</tt>" with subcommand "<tt>weights 'wt12'</tt>" and
subcommand "<tt>means</tt>".  Also test the difference of the first
and third groups using the weights in column wt13.

<p><li>1.4. (3 pts.) Do a linear regression (with the
"<tt>regress</tt>" command) using code12 and code13 as predictor
variables.  What is the best linear prediction for each of the groups?
Show that the regression equation fits the group means.

<p><li>1.5. (3 pts.) Do a <em>t</em>-test of groups 1 and 2, using the
"<tt>twot</tt>" command (you'll have to delete the rows of group 3
from the array).  Make sure to use the "<tt>pooled</tt>" subcommand.

<p><li>1.6. (2 pts.) Compare the results: Do "<tt>oneway</tt>",
"<tt>glm</tt>", and "<tt>regress</tt>" produce the same conclusions?
Circle the parts of the regression analysis in Exercise 1.4 that
correspond to the comparisons of two groups in Exercises 1.3 and 1.5.

</ul>

<p><strong>2. (8 pts)</strong>

<ul>

<p><li>2.1. (2 pts.) Plot score as a function of group, using all
three groups.

<p><li>2.2. (3 pts.) Do a linear regression of score on group (using
all three groups).  Accurately draw (by hand) the regression line on
the plot from Exercise 2.1.  What is the best linear prediction for
each of the groups (use the regression equation)?

<p><li>2.3. (3 pts.) Compare this analysis of Exercise 2.2, both
conceptually and numerically, with the results from Exercise 1.4.  Why
are the results different?

</ul>
