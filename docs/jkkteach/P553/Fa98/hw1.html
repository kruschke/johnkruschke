Homework 1: Descriptive statistics.
<br>Due 10 Sept. 1996.

<p>1. (1 pt.) Netscape.  Find a Web site that is <em>not</em> linked
to the P553 page. Print it, and turn in the first page of the print
out, and be sure to indicate the complete URL of the page (in
handwriting at the top, if necessary).

<p>2. (1 pt.) E-mail.  Send an e-mail message to both of our assistant
instructors.  In the Subject line, be sure to say "P553 Homework 1,"
so that they know what the message is for.

<p><center>For all Minitab exercises, throughout the semester, hand in
printouts of your Minitab session, <em>edited to include only the
relevant input and output</em>.</center>

<p>3. (3 pts.) In the "describe" command in Minitab, is the standard
deviation the same as the SD in Equations 2-4 through 2-6 (p.42) of
Aron and Aron?  Find out by entering this data set into Minitab: 0, 1,
2.  Compute its SD by hand and "describe" it with Minitab.  (Minitab
actually computes the <em>unbiased</em> variance and standard
deviation, which we will encounter later in the course, on p.252,
Eqns. 9-1 and 9-2 of Aron and Aron.)

<p>4. (5 pts.)  Exercise 1, Problem Set II, page 29, A&A Textbook.  Do
not do the parts (a)-(e); instead do the following: Enter the data
into minitab (use the "set" command).  Have minitab make a "tally" of
the data and a "histogram" of the data.  Have Minitab compute the mean
and standard deviation of the data (use the "describe" command). Save
these data for subsequent exercises.

<p>5. (5 pts.) For the data from the previous problem, use Minitab to
convert the raw data to z-scores (use "let c2 =
(c1-mean(c1))/stdev(c1)").  Plot a histogram of the z-scores, using
intervals analogous to the intervals in the previous problem, so that
the interval midpoints of the standardized histogram and just the
standard scores of the midpoints of the raw histogram.  What is the
standard deviation of the standardized data (use the "describe"
command)?

<p>6. (5 pts.) Exercise 1, Problem Set II, page 61, A&A Textbook.  In
your statement of the definitions, include the defining formulas, but
also be sure to state exactly what measure of variability is minimized
by each kind of central tendency, as discussed in lecture.

<p>7. (5 pts.) Exercise 3, Problem Set II, page 61, A&A Textbook.  Be
sure to think about differences in the SD's as well as in the
means.
