<p>1. (2 pts.) You are told that Jane got a score of 78 on her exam,
and that the mean was 68 with a standard deviation of 5.  What
percentage of people scored worse than Jane?  (Careful -- this is a
trick question.  Don't assume something that is not stated in the
problem!)  What additional information do you need to answer the
question?

<p>2. (5 pts.) Exercise 4, Set II, p.155 of A&A text.

<p>3. (5 pts.) Exercise 6, <em>Set I</em>, p.155 of A&A text.  Please
DO look at the answer in the back of the book, then close the book and
express an answer in your own words.

<p>4. (5 pts.) Exercise 4, Set II, p.178 of A&A text.

<p>5. (5 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.178 of A&A text.

<p>6. (3 pts.) Suppose someone claims that a certain six-sided die,
(with sides numbered 1 through 6) is biased, such that the probability
of rolling the die and getting the side with value <em>x</em> is
<em>(x**2)/91</em>.  Suppose that we roll the die once and get value
1.  Would we reject the claim? (Assume a 5% significance level, and a
two-tailed test.)  What if we roll the die once and get value 3; would
we reject the claim?
