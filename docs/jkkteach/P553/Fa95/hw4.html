P553 Statistics in Psychology<br>
Homework 4, Due 26 Sept. 1995
</h2>
</center>

For your personal edification, do the "self test" in the A&A Study
Guide for chapters 9, but don't turn it in. <p>

1.(9 pts.) Do the SPSS exercise in the Study Guide, pp.191-195, up
through item IV.A (that is, don't do parts IV.B or IV.C).  <p>

<em>Original posting included the following:</em><br> Whenever there
are two matched conditions (as opposed to a single set of scores), do
the paired-sample t-test two different ways: First, use the
"transform" command in SPSS to compute a set of difference scores and
do a single-sample t-test on the difference scores. Second, use SPSS
to do the paired t-test on the two sets of scores directly.  (You can
use the menu commands in SPSS or the syntax window, as you prefer.)
<p>

<strong>New requirements:</strong> (as of Thursday, 21 Sept.)<br> It
turns out that the SPSS menus are different for the Unix version
(which I use) and the PC version (which most of the students use).  In
the Unix version, there is a menu item for single-sample t-tests, but
apparently not in the PC version.  Therefore: <em>Whenever there are
two matched conditions (as opposed to a single set of scores), do the
paired-sample t-test one way: Use SPSS to do the paired t-test on the
two sets of scores directly.  (You can use the menu commands in SPSS
or the syntax window, as you prefer.) ALSO, it will not be possible to
use menu-driven SPSS to test single sample means in the
exercises.</em> <p>

(Friday 22 Sept.) After exploring SPSS in the Psych 120 cluster a few
minutes, I found that it will indeed do single-sample t-tests, but
there is no explicit menu item for it.  I will describe here how to do
it, but <em>you do NOT have to do this for the homework</em>.  I
explain it here so that you can check the work you do by hand, if you
want to.  I found this info under Help => Contents => SPSS Commands =>
Statistics Menu => Compare Means => Paired Samples t-Test, which
explains how to use the Paired Samples menu item for doing
single-sample tests.  First, use Transform => Compute to establish a
new variable with a constant value of zero, which will be used as the
mean against which the single group is being compared.  For example,
in the Computer dialog box, type in "compval" under Target Variable,
and type in "0.0" under Numeric Expression.  Second, use the Paired
Samples t-Test to compare the single group of interest against
"compval."<p>

2. (4 pts.) Exercise 2, Set II, p.278 of A&A text. Do this by hand
<em>and</em> with SPSS to check your results.<p>

3. (4 pts.) Exercise 4, Set II, p.278 of A&A text. Do this by hand
<em>and</em> with SPSS to check your results.  Note that it asks for
the effect size.<p>

4. (4 pts.) Exercise 5, Set II, p.278 of A&A text. Do this by hand
<em>and</em> with SPSS to check your results. <p>

5. (4 pts.) Exercise 7, Set II, p.279 of A&A text. Note that it asks
for the approximate power of the study. <p>
