<strong>

THEMES:
<ul>

<li>Science is "blind": fallible human inference about reality.  <p>

<li>Scientist as artist: theories are inherently incomplete. <br>(But
art is not science!)  <p>

<li>Science is personal: of people, by people, touches people. <p>

<li>Principle of tolerance.  <br>(Does not imply utter relativism,
that anything goes!)  <p>

<li>Potential conflict of intellectual/scientific ideas with political
ideas.  <p>

<li>"... think it possible you may be mistaken."  <p>

</ul>

SUMMARY:<p>

Formal statistical methods are a profound intellectual expression of
the culture of skepticism.  They are a monumental achievement at the
apex of human culture.  <p>

<em>"A whole conception of culture ... the conception that human
knowledge is personal and responsible, an unending adventure at the
edge of uncertainty."</em> (p.367) <p>

<em>"Every judgment in science stands at the edge of error, and is
personal.  Science is a tribute to what we can know although we are
fallible."</em> (p.374)
