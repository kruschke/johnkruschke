Be sure to review the <a href="goals.html">instructional goals</a> of
the first five weeks.<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Measures of central tendency and variability:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>Know about relative magnitudes of mode, median and mean in
skewed distributions.

	<li>Know how to compute mode, median and mean.

	<li>Know the definitions of mode, median and mean in terms of
the measures of variability that they minimize, and know how to
compute those measures of variability.

	</ul>

<li><strong>Sampling distribution of the sample mean:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>What does the sampling distribution look like for
different sample sizes?

	<li>What is the Central Limit Theorem?

	<li>What is the central tendency, variance, and shape of the
sampling distribution of the mean?

	</ul>

<li><strong>z-tests:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>For z-tests, know about effect size, power and sample
size, and be able to conduct a z-test (and know when to do so; see the
<a href="dtreemeans.gif">decision tree</a> for tests considered so
far).

	</ul>

<li><strong>t-tests:</strong>

	<ul>

	<li>For t-tests, know about effect size, power and sample
size, and be able to conduct a t-test (and know when to do so; see the
<a href="dtreemeans.gif">decision tree</a> for tests considered so
far).  Know about single-sample t-tests and paired-samples t-tests.

<p><hr><p> (This sub-message posted 11 Oct 1995)<p> Several people
have inquired about the exam question that asked for the minimal
sample size required for a certain power. We are told that mu_0 = 100,
mu_1 = 95, and sigma = 15.  What is the sample size needed for a power
of .8 or better?  Here's the solution:<p> Notice that mu_1 is LESS
than mu_0, so you can draw the picture of the sampling distributions
correctly.  Now go through the usual two steps in computering power.
First, from the null hypothesis, <br>

z_crit = -1.65 = ( M_crit - 100 ) / ( 15 / sqrt(N) )<br>

Second, from the alternative hypothesis,<br> 

z for .8 = 0.84 = ( M_crit - 95 ) / ( 15 / sqrt(N) )<br>

That gives two equations with two unknowns. Using the first equation,
we get<br>

M_crit = -1.65 * ( 15 / sqrt(N) ) + 100<br>

Plugging that into the second equation yields<br> 

0.84 = ( [ -1.65 * ( 15 / sqrt(N) ) + 100] - 95 ) / ( 15 / sqrt(N) )<br>

Solving for N yields<br>

N = [ ( 1.65*15 + .84*15 ) / (100-95) ]^2 = 55.8 <br>

So, we need N to be at least 56 for a power at least 0.8.  (If I made
an error anywhere in there, please let me know!  You can check it by
computing the power for N=56.)<p>
