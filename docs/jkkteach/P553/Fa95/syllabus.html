<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Despite the official title,
this course is an introduction to basic statistics.  We will cover
fundamental concepts of probability, sampling distributions and
statistical inference.  We will not address issues in experimental
design, nor the analysis of complex designs.  (The subsequent course
in the sequence, P554, addresses those issues.) <p>

This course is intended to bring all the incoming graduate students in
Psychology ``up to pace,'' so it is <em>not</em> intended to ``weed
out'' students with relatively weak previous training in statistics.
Students with relatively strong previous training in statistics should
also find this course useful to refresh their knowledge and to gain a
deeper understanding of the basic concepts.  Whereas most of the
examples discussed in class will come from psychology, students from
other fields are welcome. <p>

<p><strong>Campus Computers:</strong> We will be making extensive use
of the various campus computers.  <em>If you have not already done so,
please activate your network ID from UCS immediately.</em> To obtain a
network ID, take your IU (photo) student ID to the UCS Support Center,
IMU M084, where you will be given your network password and basic
information about the campus computers. Do not do that, however, if
you fall into one of the following two categories: (1) If you already
have an IU VMScluster account, but received it before 1994, you can
generate a Network ID for yourself (by entering ``joinnet'' at the
VMScluster prompt) if you have not done so already. (2) If you already
have an account that was generated for you in 1994 or 1995, then you
already have a Network ID. If you do not remember your Network ID
and/or password, stop by the UCS Support Center at IMU M084. <p>

We will use the World Wide Web and a Newsgroup for posting
announcements, homework assignments, and discussion.  You can get to
them via the Teaching section of my home page, for which the URL
is<br> http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/home.html.  <p>

We will use the statistics program called SPSS.  It is available on
the machines in the public clusters, such as PY 120, and on the campus
shared Unix and VMS machines.  UCS also offers discount prices if you
want to purchase your own copy (but this is <em>not</em> required).<p>
  
<p><strong>Required Textbooks:</strong> Aron, A. & Aron,
E. N. (1994).  <em>Statistics for Psychology</em>. Englewood Cliffs,
NJ: Prentice Hall.  Packaged with <em>Study Guide and Computer
Workbook for Statistics for Psychology</em>, by the same authors.<p>

<p><strong>Calculators:</strong> Your life will be easier (especially
during exams!) if you have a calculator that has basic statistical
operations including mean, variance (standard deviation), and
correlation/regression. Some calculators have single-variable standard
deviation, but not two-variable correlation/regression.  Be sure to
get the latter. Typically this is indicated by keys labeled with sums
(capital sigma) over ``y'' and ``xy'' besides sum over ``x.'' Also, it
seems that batteries have plenty of power until the exams, at which
time they tend to go dead.  So you might want to get a calculator
powered or assisted by photo-voltaic cells.  There are many different
brands and models that suffice, for less than $20.<p>

<p><strong>Laboratory sessions:</strong> You must attend one weekly
``lab'' session.  The lab sessions will usually be devoted to computer
demonstrations, solving example problems, and addressing questions
from students.  There is a choice of two times, one on Thursday
evening, 7:00-9:00, in PY 113, and one on Friday afternoon,
12:50-2:50, in PY 115.  During the first week of class go to whichever
one is more convenient for you, and then try to stick to that time for
the rest of the semester.<p>

<p><strong>Homework and Exams:</strong> There will be weekly homework
assignments that cumulatively count for 40% of your grade.  Homework
assignments will be posted on the Web.  Late homework will be severely
penalized: Each day late, up to three days, reduces the total possible
by 10%, and <em>after three days no points are possible</em> (unless
you have some cogent excuse, in which case you should contact me as
soon as possible).  There are two reasons for this policy: First, the
course moves quickly and the material is largely cumulative, so the
late penalty acts as an extra incentive to keep up.  Second, the
assistants, who will be grading the homework, mustn't be given a flood
of late homework papers just before each exam.<p>

You are encouraged to work together on the homework assignments to the
extent that it enhances your learning of the material, but please
write your own answers in your own words.  In your homework, please
thoroughly show all your computations, <em>with annotation</em>.  An
unannotated succession of computations will not get full credit, even
if it is ``correct.''<p>

There will be two mid-term exams and a final exam, each counting 20%
of your grade.  Each exam will heavily emphasize material from the
immediately preceding part of the course, but will also involve
material from earlier parts, so that the exams are partially
cumulative. The exams require you to work individually and quickly,
unlike the homework assignments.<p>

If you know in advance that you must miss an exam, please let me know
ahead of time, and it will usually be possible to take the exam one or
two days before the scheduled date.  If you unexpectedly miss an exam,
discuss the absence with me as soon as possible, typically the same or
next day, via phone or e-mail if not in person.<p>


<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Grading is ``on a curve,''
so that your grade depends on your performance relative to the central
tendency of the class.  As this is a graduate course, grades typically
range fairly uniformly from A to B-, and only very rarely is a C
assigned.  It is Psychology Department policy to give incompletes
(``I'' grades) only with a valid medical excuse.<p>

<p><strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes, nor copies
of overhead projector slides, are available.  If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and then please see me or one of
the assistants during our office hours if you have questions.<p>

<a name="goals"></a> <p><strong>Goals of the Course:</strong> I have
two overarching goals for this course.  The first goal is for you to
understand the basic logic of statistical inference, and to understand
how every particular case we encounter, e.g., z-tests, t-tests,
F-tests, chi-square tests, etc., are simply specific cases of the same
general logic.<p>

The basic logic of statistics is merely what any clear-thinking person
---someone like you!--- would do. Consider the basic logic of
scientific method: Given a hypothesis about the world, determine one
of its predictions, and then test whether an observation of the world
is consistent with the prediction.  Statistical inference just adds
randomness and probability: Given a hypothesis about probabilistic
tendencies in the world with random variability, determine one of its
predictions --- a prediction about implied probabilistic tendencies
and variability --- and then test whether an observation of the world
is reasonably consistent with the prediction.  The rest is ``merely''
formalizing those hypotheses, predictions, and observations.  Of
course, many brilliant statisticians and mathematicians have spent
their lives inventing, exploring, and refining formalisms that are
particularly useful, but the point is that all the formalisms are just
precise expressions of straight-forward, clear thinking.  Clear
thinking is something all of you can do, therefore proficiency in
statistics is something all of you can achieve.<p>

The second goal is for you to understand that ``Science is a very
human form of knowledge. ... Every judgment in science stands on the
edge of error, and is personal.  Science is a tribute to what we can
know although we are fallible.''  <a href="bronowski.html">(J.
Bronowski, 1973.)</a> The methods of statistics are the means by which
we stake our claims to (scientific) knowledge, and can be construed as
the ultimate expression of human culture.<p>

<strong>Schedule:</strong> The schedule below is approximate, and will
flex and bend as the course progresses.  The order of topics will
probably remain the same, but the exact dates for each topic might
change.  Exam dates, on the other hand, will remain fixed. Homework is
assigned on Tuesdays, and is due the following Tuesday, when another
assignment is given (except on exam weeks and Thanksgiving break).
This schedule is designed so that the Thursday or Friday lab sessions
can be partially devoted to discussions of the current week's
homework.
