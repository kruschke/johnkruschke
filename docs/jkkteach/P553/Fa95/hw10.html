These exercises assume a dichotomous, nominally scaled population,
with the probability of success denoted "p" and the sample size
denoted "N," unless otherwise stated.  <p>

1. (4 pts) Derive and graph the binomial distribution for p=.6, with
N=1, N=2, and N=5. Indicate the mean and SD of each.  <p>


2. (4 pts) What is the probability that at least two people in a room
of 35 have the same birthday? Assume there are 365 possible birthdays.
(HINT: Compute 1.0 minus the probability that all the birthdays are
different.)  <p>


3. (4 pts) Consider a multiple-choice test with 20 questions, each of
which has 5 possible answers. (A) Suppose a student gets 7 correct.
Can the hypothesis that the student was randomly guessing be rejected?
(HINT: It's easier to figure out the six binomial probabilities for
r=0 through r=6, and subtract from 1.0, than to figure out the
probabilities for r=7 through r=20.)  (B) Suppose a student gets just
1 correct.  Can the hypothesis of random guessing be rejected? <p>


4. (4 pts) Consider a null hypothesis of p=.5 and an alternative
hypothesis of p=.7.  For N=6, what is the power of the test?  <p>


5. (4 pts) Suppose we have a normal population with mean 0.0 and SD
1.0, from which we draw random, independent samples of size 25.  If we
draw 20 samples, what is the probability that two or more samples will
have mean greater than 0.2*1.65? (In other words, if we ran twenty
times an experiment for which the null hypothesis is true, what's the
probability of getting two or more false alarms?)  <p>

6. (5 pts total) Part A, 2 pts: A random sample of 100 students has 54
females and 46 males.  Can the null hypothesis, that the student
population has 50% females, be rejected?  Part B, 3 pts: In a random
sample of 100 students, none knew what the Poisson distribution is.
Can the hypothesis, that 1.5% of the student population knows the
definition of the Poisson, be rejected?  What if 5 students in the
sample of 100 knew the definition -- could the hypothesis be rejected? <p>

(End)
