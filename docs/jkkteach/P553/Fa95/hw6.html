For your personal edification, do the "self tests" in the A&A Study
Guide for Chapters 11 and 12, but do not turn them in. <p>

<em>When using SPSS with menus, use the menu sequence 
<pre>Statistics => Compare Means => One-Way ANOVA.</pre>  
Do not use 
<pre>Statistics => ANOVA Models.</pre></em>
(The latter will give you the same results, but in a different
format.)<p>

1. (8 pts.)  Study Guide, Ch. 11, pp.244-248, and Ch. 12, p.268.<br> Using
SPSS, conduct an ANOVA on the data given in <strong>Ch.11

<strong>Ch.12 III (all parts)</strong>.<p>

2. (6 pts.)  A&A text, p.337, Ch. 11, Set II, <strong>#2</strong>.<br>  Do
