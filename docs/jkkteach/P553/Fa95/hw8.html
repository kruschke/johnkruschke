For your personal edification, do the "self test" in the A&A Study
Guide for Chapter 16, but do not turn it in. <p>


Enter the following data into SPSS.  There are three groups of four
subjects each.  Nominal codings for the groups are also specified.
<pre>
group code1 code2 score
1     0     0     1
1     0     0     2
1     0     0     3
1     0     0     4
2     0     1     6
2     0     1     7
2     0     1     8
2     0     1     9
3     1     0     2
3     1     0     3
3     1     0     4
3     1     0     5

<strong>New (Oct.27) SPSS info:</strong> To do the linear regression
on the first two groups only (Exercise 1 part 3), you have to tell
SPSS to use only the first two groups.  It turns out that there is no
way to do that within the linear regression dialog box.  So, here
are two alternative ways to do it:
<ul>

<li>Just delete the group-three data from your data sheet.  That is,
delete the last four rows.  (You'll have to re-enter the data for
subsequent exercises.)

<li>For the SPSS-ophiles, you can set up a filter: In the data window,
go to the Data menu, down to Select Cases.  In the dialog box, click
on the button for "If condition is satisfied..." then click on the
"If..." button.  In the new dialog box, type in "group <= 2" in the
big area at the upper right.  Then click Continue, then click OK.
Don't forget to turn the filter OFF for the subsequent exercises
(under Data/ Select Cases click on the button for All Cases).

</ul>

<ol>

<li>(7 pts)
<ul>
<li>Do a t-test on the first two groups.
<li>Do a OneWay ANOVA on the first two groups only.
<li>Do a linear regression on the first two groups only.
<li>Compare the results.
</ul>

<li>(9 pts)
<ul>
<li>Do a OneWay ANOVA on all three groups, with the following contrasts:
<ul>
<li>Group 1 vs. Group 2 (use coefficients -1 1 0)
<li>Group 1 vs. Group 3 (use coefficients -1 0 1)
</ul>
<li>Do a linear regression using code1 and code 2 as independent variables.
What is the best linear prediction for each of the groups?
<li>Compare the results, including a comparison of the "contrasts" in the ANOVA
  with the "variables" in the regression equation.
</ul>

<li>(9 pts)
<ul>
<li>Do a linear regression of score on group (using all three groups).
Describe the results, and make a graph of the data with the linear
regression line.  What is the best linear prediction for each of the
groups?
<li>Compare this analysis, both conceptually and numerically, with the
results from the previous exercise (#2).
</ul>

</ol>
