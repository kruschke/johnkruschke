P553 Statistics in Psychology<br>
Homework 12, Due 12 December 1995 at the final exam (12:30).<br>
</h2>
</center>
    
<strong>You are invited to post answers, or partial answers, or
attempted answers, on the Newsgroup!  This will help people prepare
for the exam.</strong><p>

You are invited to use SPSS to solve these problems whenever possible,
<em>but be sure you are able to do these exercises by hand, because
problems like these might appear on the exam.</em><p>

1. (4 pts)  We flip a coin 5 times and find that it comes up heads 3 times.
Test the hypothesis that the coin is fair.  What assumptions have you
made?  Now the coin is flipped 500 times and comes up heads 300 times.
Test whether the coin is fair.

<p>

2. (4 pts)  Consumers of cake mixes were observed in rural and urban areas,
and the frequencies with which three brands were purchased are shown
below:

<pre>
                Duncan Hines      Pillsbury       Betty Crocker
      urban          250             200             550
      rural          100             150             300
</pre>

Test the hypothesis that the distributions of cake mix purchases for
the urban and rural consumers come from the same underlying
distribution. What assumptions have you made?

<p>
3. (6 pts) A group of 500 (otherwise normal) adults viewed a recent
popular film which explored the psychopathologies of serial killers
(in graphic detail).  After the film, half the audience was randomly
assigned to a debriefing seminar, and the other half went to a control
group situation (the restrooms).  Measurements of blood pressure were
taken immediately after the film and after the post-film treatment.
Here are data from 4 subjects in each group:

<pre>
     seminar                    control
  before after               before after
   145    136                 117   105
   128    124                 128   108
   110    109                 110   104
   117    115                 145   115
</pre>

Test the hypothesis that the reduction is the same for both groups.

<p>

Are the difference scores approximately normally distributed?  (I'm
looking for the answer "no.")  What three ways have we learned to deal
with non-normal distributions?

<p>

Apply a square root transformation to the data and test whether the
reduction is the same for both groups.

<p>

Transform the scores to ranks and conduct a t-test on the rank scores.

<p>

If you were to conduct a "Monte Carlo" method by treating the data as
the entire population, how many differences of means would you have to
compute to determine the full sampling distribution?  

<p>


4. (3 pts) The Reverend Bayes knew it's important to do the right
thing, and so he figured out Bayes' theorem to help.  Do the right
thing and figure this out: A stranger walks up to you in the parking
lot and says, "Hey, after some mathematical lucubrations, I came up
with this insightful and broadly useful relationship between
conditional probabilities," and proceeds to show you what you know is
Bayes' theorem.  If the probability of a stranger being a minister is
.001 [ p(M)=.001 ] and the probability of a stranger coming up with
Bayes' theorem is .00001 [ p(B)=.00001 ], and the probability of
coming up Bayes' theorem if you're a minister is .01 [ p(B|M)=.01 ],
then what's the probability that the stranger is a minister?

<p>

5. (4 pts) State the central limit theorem.  In what situations have
we applied it?

<p>


6. (4 pts) Test the null hypothesis that these four groups are equally
probable:

<pre>
            group   A   B   C   D
    observed freq   8   6   4   2
</pre>

Have the "rules of thumb" been satisfied?
<br>
Now test the null hypothesis for these results:

<pre>
            group   A   B   C   D
    observed freq  80  60  40  20
</pre>

Which case (N=20 or N=200) gave the chi-square value with smaller
probability (i.e., smaller probability that the null hypothesis would
yield a value that large or larger)?

<p>
