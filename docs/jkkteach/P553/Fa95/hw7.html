For your personal edification, do the "self tests" in the A&A Study
Guide for Chapters 3 and 4, but do not turn them in. <p>


For each of the data sets below, do the following: 

<ul>

<li>Compute the correlation.

<li>Test whether the correlation significantly deviates from zero.
(Two-tailed test, 5% alpha level.)

<li>Determine the approximate power of the test.

<li>Compute the proportion of variance accounted for.

<li>Make a scattergram of the <em>raw</em> scores, and accurately draw
the best fitting regression line.

<li>Make a scattergram of the <em>standardized</em> scores, and
accurately draw the best fitting regression line. (Remember that SPSS
standardizes using 1/df instead of 1/N.)

<li>Compute the predicted raw-scale value of the predicted (or
"criterion") variable when the predictor variable is the value
indicated.

</ul>

Much of this is easy to do in SPSS, but you do not have to use SPSS if
you don't want to!  Here are instructions for generating a scatterplot
with regression line in SPSS for Windows (at least, the version on the
computer Draco):
<pre>
In the DATA window, go to menu item Graphs and drag to Scatter.
  In the dialog box, click Simple, then click Define.
  In the new dialog box, specify X and Y variables, then click OK.
In the CHART window, click EDIT.
In the CHART EDIT window, go to menu item Chart and drag to Options.
  In the dialog box, click Fit Line - Total.
  Then click Fit Line Options.
    In the new dialog box, click Linear Regression.
    Then click Continue.
  In the old dialog box, click OK.

Data Set 1 (7 pts): From A&A Text p.97, Set II Exercise 3. Age is the
predictor variable, Number of People is the predicted variable.  When
the painting is only 10 years old, what is the predicted number of
people viewing it?<p>


Data Set 2 (9 pts): From 15 different pages in the phone book, select
the first name that has full first and last names indicated, and
record the number of letters in the first name and the number of
letters in the last name. Number of letters in first name is the
predictor variable, number of letters in last name is the predicted
variable.  When the first name has 8 letters, what is the predicted
number of letters in the last name?  (By the way, did you know that
the most common first name in the world is "Mohammed" and the most
common last name is "Smith"?  Or so I've heard.)<p>

Data Set 3 (9 pts): Data estimated from a graph in the Bloomington
Herald-Times.  Year is predictor variable, Tax is predicted variable.
What is the predicted tax for 1996?
