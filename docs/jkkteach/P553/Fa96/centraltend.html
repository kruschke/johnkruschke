<center><h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2> </center>

<p><strong>We choose a value M that represents the central tendency of
a distribution, such that the variability of scores x around M is
minimized.  That is, M is the value that varies least from all the
other values x.  All we need to do is formally define what we mean by
variability.</strong>

<tr>
<td>Formal Measure of Variability, V</td>
<td><center><pre>SUM( STEP( |x-M| ))</pre></center>
where STEP(x)=1 for x>0, and STEP(x)=0 otherwise</td> 
<td><center><pre>SUM( |x-M| )</pre></center></td>
<td><center><pre>SUM( (x-M)**2 ) / N</pre></center></td>
</tr>

<tr> <td>Value that Minimizes the Variability</td> <td>M minimizes V
when M is the value of a most frequent score.</td> <td>M minimizes V
when half the scores are larger and half the scores are smaller.</td>
<td><center><pre>M = SUM( x ) / N</pre></center></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Terminology</td> <td>M is called the <strong>mode</strong>.</td>
<td>M is called the <strong>median</strong>.</td> <td>M is called the
<strong>mean</strong>. The value of the minimized variability is
called the <strong>variance</strong>.</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Problems or Advantages</td> <td>Descriptive: Not unique; distributions can
be multi-modal.</td> <td>Descriptive: Not unique for even N.
<p>Inferential: Sampling distribution is difficult to generate
analytically.</td> <td>Descriptive: Over-emphasizes
outliers. <p>Inferential <em>advantage</em>: Sampling distributions of
means are analytically tractable.</td> </tr>

<p><strong>An Example:</strong> Consider the set of values, 1 2 2 3 3
3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5.  (That is, one 1, two 2's, three 3's, four 4's,
and five 5's.)  

<p>The <em>mode</em> is 5, and the (minimized) variability around that
mode is 10.

<p>The <em>median</em> is 4, and the (minimized) variability around
that median is 15.

<p>The <em>mean</em> is 3.67, and the (minimized) variance around that
mean is 1.55.
