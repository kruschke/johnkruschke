Exam 3 (Final) Sample Questions
</h2>
</center>

<p>The exam is closed-book and closed-notes, but you are encouraged to
use a calculator (and you may also bring along the calculator manual).
There are 100 points possible, with points for each problem as marked.
You have 120 minutes; please allocate your time carefully.

<p><strong>1. (35 pts total)</strong> <br>Suppose the annual salary of
people who have completed at least one statistics course is compared
against the annual salary of people who have never completed a
statistics course.  Here are the results, in dollars.  With stat's
course: 25,790; 33,115; 42,521; 54,598. Without stat's course: 36,598;
46,993; 60,340; 77,478.  (Assume random, independent sampling.)

<p><strong>1A (15 pts).</strong> Of the following data
transformations, which is the best to use in this case?  Logarithm,
Square, Exponential, Cube, Arc-sine.  Apply the best transformation
and conduct a t-test of independent means.  Assume a two-tailed test
with Type I error rate of 5%.  What are the assumptions of the test?
Have they been satisfied?

<p><strong>1B (15 pts).</strong> Transform the raw scores to rank
scores, and conduct a t-test on the rank scores.  Assume a two-tailed
test with Type I error rate of 5%.  Does your conclusion agree with
your conclusion from the previous Part?

<p><strong>1C (5 pts).</strong> Suppose we make no population
assumptions at all, and treat the eight scores in the data as
representative of the entire population, and conduct a Monte Carlo
test.  How many combinations of scores would we have to consider to
generate the full sampling distribution?  That is, what is the maximum
number of discrete ``spikes'' in the sampling distribution of
differences of means?

<p><strong>2. (35 pts total)</strong>

<p><strong>2A (10 pts).</strong> Suppose we flip a coin seven times and
it comes up heads six times.  Can we reject the null hypothesis that
the coin is fair?  Assume a two-tailed test with Type I error rate at
most 5%.


<p><strong>2B (15 pts).</strong> Suppose we have an alternative
hypothesis that the coin is biased, with probability of heads p=.75.
If we now assume a directional test, with Type I error rate at most
5% (or less), what is the power of the test?  (Again, with N=7 and
null hypothesis p=.5.)


<p><strong>2C (10 pts).</strong> Suppose we flip the coin 700 times
and it comes up heads 400 times.  Can we reject the null hypothesis
that the coin is fair?  Assume a two-tailed test with Type I error
rate at most 5%.


<p><strong>3. (30 pts total)</strong> 

<p><strong>3A (15 pts).</strong> Suppose we toss a six-sided die 65
times, and observe the following frequency distribution:

<pre>
          outcome    1   2   3   4   5   6
          frequency 12  10  15   7  18   3
</pre>

Can the null hypothesis that the die is fair be rejected?  Assume a
Type I error rate of 5%.  (Be sure to show clearly the df you are
using.)  Have any ``rules of thumb'' been violated?


<p><strong>3B (15 pts).</strong> Suppose we have a 3-sector spinner
and a coin.  We want to know whether the flip of the coin and the spin
of the spinner are independent.  Here are results from 54 pairs of
coin flips and spinner spins:

<pre>
                     Spinner
                    A   B   C
          Coin  H  13  16  10
                T   5   8   2
</pre>

Can the null hypothesis of independence be rejected?  Assume a Type I
error rate of 5%.  (Be sure to show clearly the df you are using.
Conduct the complete test even if the rules of thumb for approximating
the continuous $\chi^2$ are violated)
