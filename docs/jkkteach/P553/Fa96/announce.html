<dl>

<p><dt>Nov. 21: <dd>Tuesday's lecture (Nov. 26) is cancelled because
all the planned material for the topic of the binomial was covered in
the previous two lectures.  (See also the <a
href="binomial.html">lecture notes</a>.)

<p><dt>Oct. 31: <dd>This summer the I.U. Statistics Consortium will be
offering a <strong>time series analysis</strong> course and a
<strong>lisrel</strong> course.  They are hoping to offer a
nonparametric course as well, but are still looking for an instructor.
Coralee Sons will have more information as it arrives.

<p><dt>Oct. 15: <dd><strong>Homework 6 is postponed</strong>.
Because of Dr. Kruschke's illness, Homwork 6 will be assigned on
Thursday, Oct. 17, and will be due on Thursday, Oct. 24.  Homework 7
will be assigned and due on the regular dates, as indicated in the
syllabus.

<p><dt>Sept. 30: <dd><strong>Chuck Saxon's office hours cancelled
today.</strong>

<p><dt>Sept. 26: <dd><strong>Copying of Minitab files from my Zinc
account</strong> should now work.  UCS helped me get the right
permissions set on various directories, so you should no longer get
"permission violation" errors.

<p><dt>Sept. 20: <dd><strong>Demo of CLT-Minitab exercise, Saturday 21
Sept. at 1:00 in PY120</strong>. Matt ran into problems during lab
sections with the N-view computer -- it wouldn't connect to the
network, and hence he couldn't demonstrate the Minitab homework.  (The
N-view worked two weeks ago...!)  Matt has generously offered to
demonstrate the exercise on the computers in room 120 on Saturday 21
Sept. at 1pm.

<p><dt>Sept. 18: <dd><strong>Using the <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b103/">Pico text editor</a> on
Zinc</strong>.  The minitab exercise of <a href="hw3.html">Homework
3</a> asks you to write a file named 'clt_getsample.mtb' without
telling you in the original posting just how to do this.  On Zinc, you
can use the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b103/">Pico text
editor</a>.

<p><dt>Sept. 13: <dd><strong>Grading policy.</strong> I have been
asked to clarify the grading policy: What exactly does the syllabus
mean by "grading is on a curve"?  It means that one's final grade
depends on the central tendency of the class, and so it places all of
us into an uncomfortable position of uncertainty.  To mitigate the
uncertainty, let me report here what the "curve" was last year. What
follows is the range of weighted homework plus exam points for each
letter grade. Remember that the weighting is 40% homework and 60%
exams.  There tends to be relatively little variance in homwork
scores, so the effective weighting on exams is perhaps a bit higher
than 60%.

<pre>
(.0000 thru .7499='C')  
(.7500 thru .7999='B-')  
(.8000 thru .8299='B')
(.8300 thru .8599='B+')  
(.8600 thru .9199='A-')  
(.9200 thru 1.000='A')
</pre>

<em>This year's breakdown will probably be similar, but there is NO
implication that these percentage cutoffs will apply exactly this
year!</em> To mitigate the uncomfortableness, let me remind you that
grades in graduate classes are rarely looked at by future employers
(they care about your research); instead, grades in graduate classes
are used mostly by your home department for internal tracking of
student progress.

<p><dt>Sept. 10: <dd><strong><a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/stat/minitab/"> Minitab</a> is
now working on public PC's.</strong>

<p><strong>To get character graphics on PC's</strong>, use the command
"gstd" (for graphics standard).  This puts you back into
old-fashioned, ascii character graphics like those I show in class.
The default mode is the new and nicer "professional" graphics.  To get
to professional graphics, type "gpro".


<p><dt>Sept. 4: <dd><strong>Typo in Homwork 1</strong>. In exercise 5,
it said "...(use "set c2 = (c1-mean(c1))/stdev(c1)")...".  The "set"
should be "let".

<p><strong>Printing files from Zinc</strong>.  There
are two ways to print files from Zinc.  (You'll need to do this to get
a printout of your Minitab sessions.)  <p><em>Method 1:</em> Download
your file (using ftp) from Zinc to your local machine, and print the
file from your local machine as you would any other
file. <p><em>Method 2:</em> Print the file directly from Zinc to a
public printer.  You'll need to know the "name" of the printer to do
this; the printer in PY 120 is called "py120". The full command from
the unix prompt is <pre>lpr -Ppy120 filename</pre> For further
information on printing directly from Zinc, see <a
href="http://sckb.ucssc.indiana.edu/kb/data/adzr.html">In Unix, how do
I print files, list print jobs, and remove print jobs?</a> and <a
href="http://sckb.ucssc.indiana.edu/kb/data/abut.html">In UNIX, how do
I designate my default printer?</a>.

<p><dt>Sept. 3: <dd><strong>Minitab has problems on public
PC's.</strong> The Math/Stat center tells me that UCS is working to
fix the problem.  In the mean time, get an account on Zinc (see below)
and use Minitab on Zinc.

<p><strong>To get an account on Zinc</strong>, go to <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucshelp/Accounts/accounts.html">the
Account Services web page</a>.


<p><dt>Sept. 1:
<dd>Announcements will be posted here, in reverse chronological order,
so that the most recent announcement is listed first.
