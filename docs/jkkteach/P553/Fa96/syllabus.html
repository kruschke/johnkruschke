<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Despite the official title
("Advanced Statistics in Psychology"), this course is an introduction
to basic statistics.  We will cover fundamental concepts of sampling
distributions and statistical inference.  We will not address issues
in experimental design, nor the analysis of complex designs.  (The
subsequent course in the sequence, P554, addresses those issues.)

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This course is intended to bring
all the incoming graduate students in Psychology ``up to pace,'' so it
is not intended to ``weed out'' students with relatively weak previous
training in statistics. On the other hand, this course is definitely
not remedial.  You should have previously taken an undergraduate
course in statistics.  A purpose of P553 is to enrich and solidify
your understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of methods to which
you were previously exposed.  As a suggestive guideline, if you scored
less than 600 on your GRE Math exam, you will want to plan extra study
time to keep up in this course.

<p>Students with relatively strong previous training in statistics should
also find this course useful to refresh their knowledge and to gain a
deeper understanding of the basic concepts.  If you are a Psychology
major and have already taken a comparable graduate-level course, and
feel that you are already thoroughly familiar with the material in
P553, please see the instructor to discuss a possible exemption from
the P553 requirement.  

<p>Whereas most of the examples discussed in class will come from
psychology, students from other fields are welcome.

<p><a name="goals"></a> <p><strong>Goals of the Course:</strong> I
have two overarching goals for this course.  The first goal is for you
to understand the basic logic of statistical inference, and to
understand how every particular case we encounter, e.g., z-tests,
t-tests, F-tests, chi-square tests, etc., are simply specific cases of
the same general logic.

<p>The basic logic of statistics is merely what any clear-thinking
person (someone like you) would do. Consider the basic logic of
scientific method: Given a hypothesis about the world, determine one
of its predictions, and then test whether an observation of the world
is consistent with the prediction.  Statistical inference just adds
randomness and probability: Given a hypothesis about probabilistic
tendencies in the world with random variability, determine one of its
predictions --- a prediction about implied probabilistic tendencies
and variability --- and then test whether an observation of the world
is reasonably consistent with the prediction.  The rest is ``merely''
formalizing those hypotheses, predictions, and observations.  Of
course, many brilliant statisticians and mathematicians have spent
their lives inventing, exploring, and refining formalisms that are
particularly useful, but the point is that all the formalisms are just
precise expressions of straight-forward, clear thinking.  Clear
thinking is something all of you can do, therefore proficiency in
statistics is something all of you can achieve.

<p>The second goal is for you to understand that ``Science is a very
human form of knowledge. ... Every judgment in science stands on the
edge of error, and is personal.  Science is a tribute to what we can
know although we are fallible.''  <a href="bronowski.html">(J.
Bronowski, 1973.)</a> The methods of statistics are the means by which
we stake our claims to (scientific) knowledge, and can be construed as
the ultimate expression of human culture.

<p><a href="goals.html">Weekly topical goals</a> are listed on a
separate page, and on the web.

<p><strong>Campus Computers:</strong> We will be making extensive use
of the various campus computers.  

<ul>

<li><strong>Network ID:</strong> <em>If you have not already done so,
please activate your network ID from UCS immediately.</em> "To obtain
a network ID, From August 26 through September 13, 1996, students
should take their IU photo ID to the Walnut room of the IMU.  Hours
are Monday-Friday, 8am-7pm. On Saturday, August 30 only, the Walnut
room will also be open 9am-1pm. Workstations will be set up in the
Walnut room for you to create your Network ID and your initial
computing accounts. UCS staff will be on hand to answer any questions
you may have. ... At other times of the year, students, faculty and
staff should take their IU photo ID to the UCS Support Center, IMU
M084, Monday - Friday, 9am - 5 pm to obtain a Network ID. " (From a
UCS web page.)

<p><li><strong>World Wide Web:</strong> We will use the World Wide Web
for posting announcements, homework assignments, and discussion.  Our
class home page is

<p><li><strong>Minitab:</strong> We will use the statistics program
called <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/stat/minitab/">Minitab</a>.  It
is available on both the Macintosh and PC-Windows machines in the
public clusters, such as PY 120, and on the campus shared Unix machine
named Zinc. (To get an account on Zinc, go to <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucshelp/Accounts/accounts.html">the
Account Services web page</a>.) Use whichever platform is most
convenient for you.  There is a variety of <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/stat/minitab/">Minitab
documentation</a> available on the Web.

</ul>
  
<p><strong>Required Textbook:</strong> Aron, A. & Aron, E. N. (1994).
<em>Statistics for Psychology</em>. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice
Hall. <p>

<p><strong>Calculators:</strong> Your life will be easier (especially
during exams!) if you have a calculator that has basic statistical
operations including mean and variance (standard deviation). It seems
that batteries have plenty of power until the exams, at which time the
batteries tend to go dead.  So you might want to get a calculator
powered or assisted by photo-voltaic cells.  There are many different
brands and models that suffice, for less than $15.

<p><strong>Laboratory sessions:</strong> You must attend one weekly
``lab'' session.  The lab sessions will usually be devoted to solving
example problems, computer demonstrations, and addressing questions
from students.  There is a choice of two times, one on Thursday
evening, 7:00-9:00, in PY 113, and one on Friday afternoon,
12:50-2:50, in PY 115.  During the first week of class go to whichever
one is more convenient for you, and then try to stick to that time for
the rest of the semester.

<p><strong>Homework and Exams:</strong> There will be weekly homework
assignments that cumulatively count for 40% of your grade.  Homework
assignments will be posted on the Web.  Late homework will be severely
penalized: Each day late, up to three days, reduces the total possible
by 10%, and <em>after three days no points are possible</em> (unless
you have some cogent excuse, in which case you should contact me as
soon as possible).  There are two reasons for this policy: First, the
course moves quickly and the material is largely cumulative, so the
late penalty acts as an extra incentive to keep up.  Second, the
assistants, who will be grading the homework, mustn't be given a flood
of late homework papers just before each exam.

<p>You are encouraged to work together on the homework assignments to
the extent that it enhances your learning of the material, but please
write your own answers in your own words.  In your homework, please
thoroughly show all your computations, <em>with annotation</em>.  An
unannotated succession of computations will not get full credit, even
if it is ``correct.''

<p>There will be two mid-term exams and a final exam, each counting
20% of your grade.  Each exam will heavily emphasize material from the
immediately preceding part of the course, but will also involve
material from earlier parts, so that the exams are partially
cumulative. <em>The exams require you to work individually and
quickly, unlike the homework assignments.</em>

<p>If you know in advance that you must miss an exam, please let me
know ahead of time, and it will usually be possible to take the exam
one or two days before the scheduled date.  If you unexpectedly miss
an exam, discuss the absence with me as soon as possible, typically
the same or next day, via phone or e-mail if not in person.

<p><strong>Course Grading Method:</strong> Grading is ``on a curve,''
so that your grade depends on your performance relative to the central
tendency of the class.  As this is a graduate course, grades typically
range fairly uniformly from A to B-, and only rarely is a C or less
assigned.  It is Psychology Department policy to give incompletes
(``I'' grades) only with a valid medical excuse.

<p><strong>Lecture Notes:</strong> Neither lecture notes, nor copies
of overhead projector slides, are available.  If you must miss a
lecture, get notes from a classmate, and then please see me or one of
the assistants during our office hours if you have questions.

<p><strong>Schedule:</strong>A <a href="schedule.html">detailed
schedule</a> is shown on a separate page.</a>


<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This syllabus is meant to be suggestive,
not absolute. Any and all of the information on this syllabus is
subject to change at any time, including exam dates, grading policies,
office hours, etc. Changes will be announced in class.
