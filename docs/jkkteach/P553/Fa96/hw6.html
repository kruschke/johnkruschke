<h2>
P553 Statistics in Psychology
<br>Homework 6: One-way ANOVA.
<br>Due 24 October 1996.
</h2>
</center>

<p>1. (5 pts.) Generate sampling distributions for the F statistic
using the Minitab code at the bottom of this page. (The code is
restricted to three groups; what does this mean for the <em>df</em> of
the distribution?)  For each generated distribution, is its mean close
to what we would expect theoretically?  For each generated
distribution, determine the .05 critical value.  Look up the tabled
critical value (and state it in your homework).  Are the two critical
values close?

<p>2. (8 pts.)  A&A text, p.337, Ch. 11, Set II,
<strong>#2</strong>. <br>Do each part by hand, and check each part
with Minitab (use the "oneway" command).  What is the proportion of
variance accounted for by group membership?  Also compute the effect
size and approximate power for each part.  Notice that all that
differs between part (a) and part (b) is the mean of Group 2, but the
<em>range</em> of group means is the same.  What part of the F
statistics does this difference affect?

<p>3. (5 pts.)  A&A text, Ch. 11, p.337, Set II,
<strong>#3</strong>. <br>Do by hand, and check with Minitab.  What is
the proportion of variance accounted for by group membership?  Also
compute the effect size and approximate power.  Do <em>not</em>
"explain your answer to a person who ... is unfamiliar with analysis
of variance".

<p>4. (7 pts.) A&A text, Ch. 11, p.336, <strong>Set I, #6</strong>.
<br> Do <em>not</em> use the list of random numbers supplied on p.336;
instead, use Minitab to generate 30 random page numbers as follows:
First, from your own dictionary determine how many pages of words
there are. For example, my Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary has
1365 pages of words.  Then in Minitab I would type

<pre>
#
# 1365 below is the number of pages; change it to your value.
# c4 below is just an arbitrary column.
#
random 30 c4;
uniform 1 1365.
round c4 c4
print c4
</pre>

With the resulting random page numbers, look up the words as directed
in the problem, <em>and include the words you find in your
homework</em>.  With the resulting data, do an ANOVA by hand and
verify with Minitab.  What is the proportion of variance accounted for
by group membership?  Also determine the power and necessary sample
size as asked in the problem.  Finally, is this truly random sampling
of nouns, adjectives, and verbs?

<p>Below are the Minitab commands for demonstrating the sampling
distribution of the <em>F</em> statistic in Exercise 1.  This code is
restricted to three groups.  You can (1) just type them into Minitab
line by line, or (2) if you know how, you can download this page to
your Mac or PC, edit away all the text above, and then execute it in
Minitab, or (3) if you use Zinc, you can copy it from my directory:
/N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/F.mtb and /N/fs2/kruschke/Zinc/F_getsample.mtb.

<p>To write the file named 'F_getsample.mtb', on Zinc you can use the
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b103/">Pico text editor</a>.

<pre>
# In a separate file named 'F_getsample.mtb', include the following 12 lines.
# (The long lines should be all on one line, not split across lines.)
# 
# random 'N' 'sample1';
# normal 0.0 1.0.
# random 'N' 'sample2';
# normal 0.0 1.0.
# random 'N' 'sample3';
# normal 0.0 1.0.
# let 'gm' = (mean('sample1')+mean('sample2')+mean('sample3'))/3.0
# let 'msb' = 'N'*((mean('sample1')-'gm')**2+(mean('sample2')-'gm')**2+(mean('sample3')-'gm')**2)/(3-1)
# let 'msw' = (('N'-1)*(stdev('sample1')**2)+('N'-1)*(stdev('sample2')**2)+('N'-1)*(stdev('sample3')**2))/(3*('N'-1))
# let 'F'('rowindex') = 'msb'/'msw'
# let 'rowindex' = 'rowindex' + 1
# end
#
######################################################################################################################
#
# Now initialize the sampling variables
#
name c1 'sample1'
name c2 'sample2'
name c3 'sample3'
name c4 'F'
name k1 'N'
name k2 'rowindex'
name k3 'gm'
name k4 'msb'
name k5 'msw'
#
# Now draw 500 samples of size 3 from each group, and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample F
#
let 'N' = 3
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'F_getsample.mtb' 500
histogram 'F'
describe 'F'
#
# Now draw 500 samples of size 21 from each group, and 
# plot the sampling distribution of the sample F
#
let 'N' = 21
let 'rowindex' = 1
noecho
execute 'F_getsample.mtb' 500
histogram 'F'
describe 'F'

# end
