<h2>
P335 Cognitive Psychology, Prof. Kruschke
<br>Relevance Paper Evaluation Form
<p>What do <em>you</em> think about this assignment?
</h2>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, one of
the goals of this course is for you to discover the relevance of
cognitive psychology to everyday life.  The "relevance paper"
assignments are designed to help you achieve this goal.  

<p>Please tell Professor Kruschke whether this assignment achieved
this goal, by filling out the form below.  Although your evaluation is
not anonymous, the content of your reply has no impact on your grade
whatsoever.  Your sincere evaluation will help improve future
assignments, and you get 2 points for your effort (just once per
paper, of course).

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You may only submit an evaluation of
a relevance paper assignment after it was due but before the next one
is due.  For example, an evaluation of the 2nd paper assignment must
be submitted after it is due but before the 3rd one is due.  You may
not submit an evaluation of an assignment before it is due, nor after
the next one is due.
