<li><strong>Mouse clear?</strong> Make sure that the mouse is accessible,
unsnarled, and unobstructed.

<li><strong>Netscape?</strong> Make sure you are running Netscape
(not Windows Explorer, etc).

<li><strong>Window's taskbar hidden?</strong> Move the mouse cursor
all the way to bottom of the screen, where the Window's taskbar is (or
should be). <em>Right</em> click on any blank space in the taskbar
(e.g., under [not on] the Start button). Click "Properties". Under
"Taskbar options" be sure that "Always on top" is <em>NOT</em>
checked, and "Auto hide" <em>is</em> checked. Then click "Apply" and
"OK".

<li><strong>Window maximized?</strong> Make sure to maximize the
web browser window, so that the browser window covers the entire
computer screen. Do this as follows: First, locate the three buttons
at the top-right of the window. The middle of these three buttons has
a rectangle (the left has a lower line; the right has an X). Click the
middle button that has the rectangle. <em>The Netscape window should
now cover the entire screen.</em>

<li><strong>NO Netscape toolbars?</strong> On the "View" menu, under
"Show", be sure that none of the toolbars is checked. The top of the
Netscape window should have only the "File Edit View Go..." line
showing, and no other toolbars.

<li><strong>Font size correct?</strong> Adjust the font size by
going to the "View" menu and then clicking on "Increase font" or
"Decrease font" until the row of numerals below is a large as possible
without a scroll bar appearing at the bottom of the window.
