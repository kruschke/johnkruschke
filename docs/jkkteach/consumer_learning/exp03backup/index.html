<li><strong>Mouse clear?</strong> Make sure that the mouse is accessible,
unsnarled, and unobstructed.

<li><strong>Netscape?</strong> Make sure you are running Netscape
(not Windows Explorer, etc).

<li><strong>Window's taskbar hidden?</strong> Move the mouse cursor
all the way to bottom of the screen, where the Window's taskbar is (or
should be). <em>Right</em> click on any blank space in the taskbar
(e.g., under [not on] the Start button). Click "Properties". Under
"Taskbar options" be sure that "Always on top" is <em>NOT</em>
checked, and "Auto hide" <em>is</em> checked. Then click "Apply" and
"OK".

<li><strong>Window maximized?</strong> Make sure to maximize the
web browser window, so that the browser window covers the entire
computer screen. Do this as follows: First, locate the three buttons
at the top-right of the window. The middle of these three buttons has
a rectangle (the left has a lower line; the right has an X). Click the
middle button that has the rectangle. <em>The Netscape window should
now cover the entire screen.</em>

<li><strong>Only the BACK button toolbar?</strong> On the "View"
menu, under "Show", be sure that only the Navigation toolbar is
checked, and that all other toobars are <em>un</em>checked. That is,
the only toolbar visible should be the one with a BACK button.

<li><strong>Font size correct?</strong> Adjust the font size by
going to the "View" menu and this clicking on "Increase font" or
"Decrease font" until the row of numerals below is a large as possible
without a scroll bar appearing at the bottom of the window.
