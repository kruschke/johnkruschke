<p><b>Introductory talk:</b> Many fields of science are transitioning from null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to Bayesian data analysis. There are many foundational problems with NHST. A few of these problems will be illustrated in the context of familiar t tests and multiple comparisons. Essentially, p values and the limits of confidence intervals depend strongly on the intentions of analyst, despite the fact that those intentions have no impact on the data. Moreover, confidence intervals carry no distributional information and are only minimally useful for predicting new data. On the other hand, Bayesian data analysis does not suffer these problems. Bayesian analysis provides complete information about the relative credibilities of all candidate parameter values. Bayesian analysis applies seamlessly to small samples, large samples, unbalanced designs, missing data, outliers, etc. Bayesian analysis software is flexible and can be used for a wide variety of data-analytic models. And it's free.

<p>The <b>workshop</b> shows you how to do Bayesian data analysis,
hands on (with free software called R and JAGS).
<!-- The software is free; <b>see installation instructions, <a
href="#beforeArriving">below</a>, <em>before</em> arriving at the
tutorial</b>. -->
The intended audience is grad students, faculty, and other researchers who want
a ground-floor introduction to Bayesian data analysis. No mathematical
expertise is presumed.
<!-- If you can handle a few minutes of summation notation like
&Sigma;<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub> and integral notation like
&int;&nbsp;x&nbsp;dx, you're good to go. Complete computer programs
will be worked through, step by step. -->

<p><b>Workshop Agenda:</b>
<ul>
<!-- <li> Quick review of <b>the perils of <i>p</i> values</b> discussed in the Introductory Talk. (More reasons to go Bayesian are linked <a href="#whyGoBayesian">below</a>. See also Figure 1.) -->
<li> <b>Bayes' rule, grid approximation, and R.</b>
<li> <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo and JAGS.</b> This does not involve any physical restraints. Unfortunately, it also does not involve Monte Carlo.
<!-- <li> <b>Coffee break!</b> Everything tastes better when it's Bayesian. -->
<li> <b>Bayesian comparison of means and Bayesian ANOVA with multiple comparisons.</b> Bayesian analysis provides complete distributional information about parameter values and avoids fatal flaws in null hypothesis significance testing.
</ul>
<!-- <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -->
You do not need to bring a notebook computer to the workshop. But you are invited to bring one, so that you can run the programs and see how their output corresponds with the presentation material. If you want to bring a notebook computer to the workshop, you must install the software <i>before arriving at the workshop</i>, because there will not be time to do it during the presentation. <b>For complete instructions, please refer to <a href="http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2012/01/complete-steps-for-installing-software.html" target="_blank">this blog entry</a>.</b>

Kruschke</a> is five-time winner of Teaching Excellence Recognition
Awards from Indiana University, where he is Professor of Psychological
and Brain Sciences, and Adjunct Professor of Statistics. He has
written <a

interests include the science of moral judgment, applications of Bayesian
methods to teaching and learning, and models of attention in learning,
which he has developed in both connectionist and Bayesian
formalisms. He received the Troland Research Award from the National
Academy of Sciences. He is action editor for the <i>Journal of Mathematical Psychology</i>, and is on the editorial boards of <i>Psychological Review</i>, the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i>, among others.
