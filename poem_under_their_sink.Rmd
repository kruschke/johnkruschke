## Under Their Sink

<!-- 168 words -->

[Withheld until two months after publication; see poem at link below.]

<!-- Underneath their kitchen sink, the shiny\ -->
<!-- red cylinder stands vigilant, ready\ -->
<!-- to rescue them from their flammable home,\ -->
<!-- extinguishing fires, with its thick foam,\ -->
<!-- that erupt from oven, stove top, or fears,\ -->
<!-- though flames never appeared in all these years.\ -->

<!-- In their TV cabinet, there is no\ -->
<!-- sentinel for dousing the inferno\ -->
<!-- of contempt and dehumanization\ -->
<!-- that rages uncontrolled on the flat screen,\ -->
<!-- fought with backfires they might set someday;\ -->
<!-- meanwhile, they backlight a candle and pray.\ -->

<!-- In the bedroom, a small candle toils\ -->
<!-- to effuse, for lovers, essence oils,\ -->
<!-- and to distract, by flickering shadows,\ -->
<!-- the mental ceiling sprinklers spraying to-do's,\ -->
<!-- agendas, disappointments, and regrets\ -->
<!-- that swamp their pelvic floors, make their feet wet.\ -->

<!-- And in the children's rooms, the foam is deep,\ -->
<!-- sprayed thick with good intentions, there to keep\ -->
<!-- the children safe from self-immolation\ -->
<!-- by unrealistic expectation\ -->
<!-- of growing up to become an artist,\ -->
<!-- musician, astronaut, or novelist.\ -->
<!-- When grown, their recompense will be to think\ -->
<!-- of the extinguisher under their sink.\ -->

*Notes:* 
Ironies of fire extinguishers: Under the kitchen sink but never used, needed at the TV but not available, not wanted in the bedroom but mentally applied anyway, and used on ambitions of children -- who grow up to repeat what they've learned.
Regarding form: Every line is *decasyllabic*, with rhyming pairs of lines.
